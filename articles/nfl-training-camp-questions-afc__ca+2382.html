                        <p>We're in late July and that means the start of the NFL is right around the corner. Training camps are getting ready to start and each team has a question or several heading into camp. Without preseason, camps and practices will be more important considering players are going to need to get used to hitting.</p><p>Let's start with the AFC</p><p><strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Under Armour Performance Center, Owings Mills, Md.</p><p><em>Biggest question? Can the Ravens turn a strong regular season into postseason success?</em></p><p>Coming off a 14-2 season, the Ravens need to figure out how to win in the playoffs. Lamar Jackson is coming off an MVP season, but he still has to work on getting better rapport with his receivers. He'll need to find other wideouts aside from friend Hollywood Brown. Ravens also need to find a replacement at right guard for future Hall of Famer Marshall Yanda. D.J. Fluker appears to be the favorite there due to his experience. On defense, Baltimore needs to find more pass rush and figure out the inside linebacker spot with rookie Patrick Queen expected to be the starter from jump.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bills</strong></p><p>Training Camp: One Bills Drive, Orchard Park, New York</p><p><em>Biggest Question? Will Josh Allen become more accurate now that Stefon Diggs has joined the team?</em></p><p>The Bills went from nice story to a potential favorite in the AFC East. That may have changed when New England picked up Cam Newton, but the Bills can always use that as a lack of respect by oddsmakers. Josh Allen, like Jackson, made big strides last season as a passer. The addition of Stefon Diggs will help, but he can always get sharper and more accurate. Second-year player Ed Oliver could be a real force this year on the inside. Can he overcome some off-the-field issues to live up to his potential?</p><p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Paul Brown Stadium (Cincinnati)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Joe Burrow take over as the starter in training camp?</em></p><p>Joe Burrow was the number one pick in the draft and with Andy Dalton gone, he's the starting quarterback from Day One. The Bengals are not the perfect fit, but they do have a quarterback-friendly coach in Zac Taylor. The question is not only how Burrow will adjust to faster defensive backs and defensive ends, but also finding some chemistry with his receivers. Another question would be the health of A.J. Green, who has been hampered by injuries the last two seasons. If he's 100%, Burrow's adjustment period will be a lot easier.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Cleveland Browns Training Complex (Berea, Ohio)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Kevin Stefanski get the best out of Baker Mayfield?</em></p><p>Mayfield had the definition of a sophomore slump in 2019. He was turnover-prone, lost his poise and the coaching staff didn't help. Stefanski plans to rely more on the running game this season and why not? When you have Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt, that's the way to go. The Browns have plenty of weapons at receiver and at tight end, with Austin Hooper entering the picture. But going with different run-formations should help Mayfield find more open options in the passing game.</p><p><strong>Denver Broncos</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Paul D. Bowlen Memorial Centre (Dove Valley, Colorado)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Drew Lock get the job done as a full-time starter?</em></p><p>Lock showed some flashes last year taking over for Joe Flacco. John Elway added more weapons in the offseason, led by rookie Jerry Jeudy from Alabama and running back Melvin Gordon from the Chargers. Lock has the size and big arm that Elway likes. He also has the toughness in the pocket, but defensive coordinators will adjust to him after seeing him as a rookie. Will he make the necessary adjustments to help the Broncos make the playoffs?</p><p><strong>Houston Texans</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Houston Texans Training Center (Houston)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Who will replace DeAndre Hopking at wide receiver?</em></p><p>Hopkins was one of the top receivers in the NFL for several seasons, so it's not likely that the Texans can just find his replacement. Brandin Cooks is a very good receiver when healthy, but there are certainly questions about his future (concussions). Will Fuller is a burner and Randall Cobb is a veteran slot receiver. None of them are Hopkins in his prime, so Deshaun Watson is going to have to spread the ball around more. The offensive line is also a question makr and Watson at times, needs to get rid of the ball quicker to avoid unncessary hits.</p><p><strong>Indianapolis Colts</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center (Indianapolis)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Does Philip Rivers still have it?</em></p><p>Rivers struggled last season as age finally began to show. He was great in 2018 but struggled with 23 turnovers last season. Fortunately, he plays behind a very good offensive line, after playing behind a poor line in Los Angeles. He'll need a healthy T.Y. Hilton, who has made four Pro Bowls. When Hilton is out, the Colts are 1-9 during his career. Parris Campbell showed some flashes as a rookie, but needs to be more consistent in his rookie season. They also added USC WR Michael Pittman Jr., so Rivers should have nearly as good a WR corps as he had with the Chargers.</p><p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></p><p>Training Camp: TIAA Bank Field (Jacksonville, Fla)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Is Gardner Minshew for real?</em></p><p>The Jaguars could be one of the worst teams in football and they are basically in rebuild mode. They have issues all over the place including at defensive end, where Yannick Ngakoue has been complaining all off-season about being hit with the franchise tag. He may not show up at all. Then there's Gardner Minshew, who threw 16 TDs and one pick in the red zone last season, but also had seven fumbles. The Jags have to figure out if he's going to be the future at quarterback, or just a solid backup.</p><p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Kansas City Chiefs Practice Facility (Kansas City, Mo.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Who replaces Laurent Duvernay-Tardif at right guard?</em></p><p>Duvernay-Tardif became the first NFL player to opt out of the 2020 season and was the right guard for the Chiefs. That's basically the only thing that has gone wrong for Kansas City since the Super Bowl win. They already had to replace left guard Stefen Wisniewski, who signed with the Steelers in free agency. They did add veteran Kelechi Osemele, who has been hampered by injuries with the Raiders and Jets in the last two seasons.</p><p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Raiders Headquarters (Henderson, Nevada)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Will Derek Carr be pushed by Marcus Mariota at quarterback?</em></p><p>The Raiders move to Las Vegas and that's the biggest story. But once they are acclimated, it will be at quarterback, where Derek Carr needs to win games. He's putting up pretty good stats and completed 70.4% of his passes last season. He also has a fast tight end in Darren Waller and possibly the next Tyreek Hill in Henry Ruggs III. But with Marcus Mariota now in the fold, head coach Jon Gruden is not going to have a lot of patience if the Raiders aren't winning.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Chargers</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Jack Hammett Sports Complex (Costa Mesa, Calif.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: How will long can Tyrod Taylor hold off Justin Herbert at quarterback?</em></p><p>The Philip Rivers era is finally over with the Chargers. Rivers never even got the Chargers to the Super Bowl, but it wasn't all his fault. He just happened to play in the era of Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. But in 2019, Rivers started to fade and show his age. The Chargers picked up veteran Tyrod Taylor, who had a few chances to start in Cleveland and Buffalo. He showed some flashes, but couldn't get over the hump and was known mainly as a game-manager. Taylor is going to have to do more than that to keep the job over rookie Justin Herbert, who is much bigger. But Herbert is also raw and not as polished as top pick Joe Burrow.</p><p><strong>Miami Dolphins</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Baptist Health Training Facility (Davie, Fla.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Will Miami hold out Tua Tagovailoa this season as a redshirt?</em></p><p>Miami hasn't had a star quarterback since Dan Marino was quarterbacking back in the eighties and early nineties. Tua-mania may have to hold off considering he's coming off a hip injury and several other injury issues over his college career. Ryan Fitzpatrick is a solid band-aid until he's ready to go and the Fins are not looking at competing right away. The key is having Tagovailoa for the long run and not risking injury in his first season. With no fans or few fans in that first season, it's not like they are trying to sell tickets.</p><p><strong>New England Patriots</strong></p><p>Training camp: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough, Mass.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Is Cam Newton healthy enough to take over as starting quarterback for Tom Brady?</em></p><p>Newton was an obvious choice to replace Brady, only because there were no other options available. Newton is the antithesis of what Brady was in his prime, though both certainly have their questions. Brady due to his age and Newton due to injuries. He'll have four weeks to get in sync with Josh McDaniels and that offensive system. McDaniels will need to mold his offense to Newton's strengths, but can the former MVP run as well as he used to? Considering the injuries, he'll run less, but you can't completely take that away from him.</p><p><strong>New York Jets</strong></p><p>Training camp: Atlantic Health Jets Training Center (Florham Park, New Jersey)</p><p>Biggest question: Can McDonald replace Jamal Adams at safety?</p><p>Jamal Adams was a very good safety, but he wasn't happy being on the Jets or playing for Adam Gase. It just wasn't worth keeping him around. Marcus Maye is steady at one safety spot, but who will play strong safety? Enter Bradley McDougal, who came over from Seattle in the Adams trade. He did have 70 tackles and two picks last season and has been steady since replacing Kam Chancellor, but he's just that. The Jets also need to find out if Sam Darnold is ready to take the next step at quarterback and can the offense go from the basement to the penthouse or close to it, in one season.</p><p><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Heinz Field (Pittsburgh)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Is Ben Roethlisberger healthy and in shape?</em></p><p>Big Ben tends to look like a defensive tackle more than a quarterback at times. He's never going to look like Drew Brees or run like Lamar Jackson, but the Steelers just need to him to stay healthy. He'll help the receiving corps and the offense as a whole if he can stay healthy, assuming he hasn't started a big decline. He played in three games last season before undergoing season-ending elbow surgery. He looked fine before the injury and if he's back to being 75% of his prime, the Steelers will be in the playoffs thanks to a nasty defense.</p><p><strong>Tennessee Titans</strong></p><p>Training Camp: Saint Thomas Sports Park (Nashville, Tn).</p><p><strong>Biggest question: Will the Titans be able to use last year's formula to the same degree of success?</strong></p><p>Ryan Tannehill helped the Titans get to the AFC Championship Game by managing the team well and mainly handing off to Derrick Henry. There was nothing fancy about that formula, but it did work. Tannehill earned a huge extension and Marcus Mariota left for the Las Vegas Raiders in free agency. Tannehill was extremely accurate (70.3%) and thanks to Henry, was absurdly good in the play-action game. Defenses will try and adjust to stopping the run this season and forcing Tannehill to beat them.</p><p><em>(some info gleaned from CBSsports and ESPN.com)</em></p>
