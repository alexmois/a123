                        <p>NFL Week 5 Betting Recap</p><p>There were some bizarre plays that may have cost people betting pools, parlays, teasers and regular bets. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each game and look at the betting implications that occurred and may also affect the line in Week 5 and beyond.</p><p>(closing lines) (Home team in caps)</p><p><strong>Thursday, Oct. 8</strong></p><p><strong>Indianapolis (+3.5) over DENVER 12-9ot</strong></p><p>This was one of the worst NFL games in recent memory. The only side that mattered in this one was the total-the under. Matt Ryan (251 yds, 2 INTs) and Russell Wilson (274 yds, 2 INTs) were horrible. Now, we&rsquo;re finding out that Wilson has an injured throwing shoulder and should be ready to go on Monday. That win may have saved Frank Reich&rsquo;s job but the major concern is Jonathan Taylor&rsquo;s ankle and whether will he be ready to go. Backup Nyheim Hines (concussion) was injured in their first series and is listed as questionable.</p><p><strong>Sunday, Oct. 11</strong></p><p><strong>NY Giants (+9) over Green Bay 27-22</strong></p><p>This one, from London, was a shocker. The Packers blew a 17-3 lad in the first half and the Giants shocked the world and moved to 4-1 on the season. QB Daniel Jones managed the offense well with 217 yards passing (21 of 27), while Saquon Barkley had 70 yards rushing and a score with 36 yards receiving. The Giants also held the Packers to just 301 yards of offense. The Green Bay defense is becoming a concern and so is Aaron Rodgers&rsquo; thumb as he missed Wednesday&rsquo;s practice.</p><p><strong>LA Chargers (-1.5) over CLEVELAND 30-28</strong></p><p>This was a wild one as most Chargers&rsquo; games are. Austin Ekeler finally broke out with 173 yards rushing and two TDs. Let&rsquo;s start with the game-winning 27-yard field goal by Taylor Bertolet with 9:29 left. But Brandon Staley nearly gave the Browns the game by going for it on 4th-and-2 from the LA 46 with 1:13 left and gave the Browns a chance. Fortunately for Chargers&rsquo; fans and bettors (unless they got a push), Cade York missed a 54-yarder with 11 seconds left. In terms of injuries, WR Keenan Allen (hamstring) should finally return this week.</p><p><strong>NEW ENGLAND (-3.5) over Detroit 29-0</strong></p><p>How impressive was the New England defense? They shut out one of the league&rsquo;s most prolific offenses. Rookie QB Bailey Zappe completed 17 of 21 for 188 yards with one TD and one INT. He could potentially start again this week, even if Mac Jones (ankle) is ready, though he was limited at practice on Wednesday. Rhamondre Stevenson ran for 161 yards to take over for Damien Harris (hamstring), who may not play this week. The Lions need a healthy Amon-Ra-St. Brown, who had just four catches for 18 yards. They will probably not have CB Savion Smith (concussion) for their next game. Though the Lions do have a bye this week.</p><p><strong>Atlanta (+9.5) over TAMPA BAY 15-21</strong></p><p>So this is one of the several games where a questionable roughing the passer penalty had an impact on the game. Fortunately for Atlanta bettors, it didn&rsquo;t hamper their bet. But Atlanta did have a chance to win outright when Grady Jarrett was called a roughing the passer penalty on Tom Brady on a third down to extend the Bucs&rsquo; last drive of the game. The Falcons were unable to provide much offense in this one, as they were held to 261 yards. Getting TE Kyle Pitts back from a hamstring injury would help. Brady threw for 351 yards with one TD as Leonard Fournette caught 10 passes for 83 yards and a TD.</p><p><strong>NEW ORLEANS (-5.5) over Seattle 39-32</strong></p><p>This one was a tough one for Seattle bettors, but an easy one for those who liked the over. The Seahawks decided to go for two down 31-25 for some reason (analytic) in the beginning of the fourth quarter and did not convert. But this game was about backup QB Taysom Hill who ran for three touchdowns including a 60-yard run with 5:22 left (NO converted 2-point conversion for the cover). He also had a 22-yard passing TD to TE Adam Troutman late in the third quarter. If Jameis Winston (back/ankle) returns this week, it will be interesting to see if he plays at all in wildcat situations. You really can&rsquo;t question what Geno Smith has done for the Seahawks (268 yds, 3 TDs), but the defense continues to be a huge problem. They also lost RB Rashaad Penny (broken fibula/ankle sprain) for the season.</p><p><strong>Houston (+7) over JACKSONVILLE 13-6</strong></p><p>This was another shocker and a borefest of a game. The Jags were beginning to make strides and their offense was held to no touchdowns at home, by Houston of all teams. Trevor Lawrence took a few steps backward, going 25 of 47 for 286 yards with two picks. He just couldn&rsquo;t finish drives and Houston compiled just 248 yards of offense and allowed 422 yards. Houston and the under had a great ring to it after the game was over.</p><p><strong>BUFFALO (-14) over Pittsburgh 38-3</strong></p><p>Just complete domination by Buffalo in the wind at home. Not a lot to say about this one. Rookie QB Kenny Pickett did throw for 327 yards with a pick in his first start, but that&rsquo;s not the Steelers&rsquo; formula to win. They ran for just 54 yards on 17 carries and once the game got out of hand, had to throw the ball. Josh Allen had a typical game for him, but he was helped out by Gabe Davis, who had 3 catches for 171 yards and two TDs including a 98-yarder and a 62-yarder where he stole the ball from Minkah Fitzpatrick. The bills may also be getting injured star corner Tre&rsquo;Davious White (knee) back shortly as he practiced on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>NY JETS (+3.5) over Miami 40-17</strong></p><p>The Jets took advantage of Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) being out and then knocked backup Teddy Bridgewater (protocol) out of the game. However, give the Jets credit as they were able to run the ball down the Jets&rsquo; throats. Rookie RB Breece Hall with 97 yards rushing and 100 yards receiving. Zach Wilson managed the game with 210 yards passing and no turnovers. He also caught a touchdown pass. The bigger concern for Miami is at QB as Skylar Thompson is expected to star with Bridgewater (head) and Tagovailoa probably not playing. They are also having issues with WR Tyreek Hill (foot) and CB Xavien Howard (groin), who are expected to play.</p><p><strong>Tennessee (-1.5) over WASHINGTON 21-17</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s starting to get ugly in Washington (again). The Commanders had a chance to win as they drove from their own 11-yard line to the Titans&rsquo; two. But Carson Wentz&rsquo;s pass was picked off by David Long with six seconds left to give the Titans the road win. It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty effort for the Titans as Ryan Tannehill was sacked five times and threw for 181 yards. Wentz had a strong effort with 359 yards passing including two by Dyami Brown. Derrick Henry rushed for 102 yards with two TDs for the Titans. Brown is listed as questionable for the Thursday night game with a groin injury and Washington is already playing without speedy rookie Jahan Dotson (hamstring).</p><p><strong>Chicago (+7.5) over MINNESOTA 22-29</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s another tough loss for the fave bettors. The Vikes had complete control of the game early on, jumping out to a 21-3 lead. The Bears showed a pulse in the second half and scored 19 straight points to take a 22-21 lead. Kirk Cousins ran it from one yard out to give the Vikes the win. Greg Joseph missed two field goal attempts and that didn&rsquo;t help the Minnesota pick. Cousins threw for 296 yards with a TD and a pick, while Dalvin Cook ran for 94 yards and two TDs. For Chicago, RB David Montgomery returned and caught four passes for 61 yards. Justin Field had 47 yards rushing and 208 yards passing with a TD on 15 of 21.</p><p><strong>San Francisco (-6.5) over CAROLINA 37-15</strong></p><p>This was the last game for Matt Rhule as a Carolina coach. Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 253 yards and two TD. Jeff Wilson Jr. ran for 120 yards and a TD for the 49ers. The Panthers gave up 397 yards to a decent but not great offense. Emmanuel Mosley also returned an interception for a TD for the Niners. However, Mosley suffered a torn ACL later in the game and is out for the season. San Francisco is already playing without CB Jimmie Ward (hand surgery). Panthers QB Baker Mayfield (ankle) was injured in this game and probably won&rsquo;t play on Sunday. With Sam Darnold (ankle) still out, P.J. Walker is likely to get the start at the Rams.</p><p><strong>Dallas (+5.5) over LA RAMS 22-10</strong></p><p>Dallas continues their strong play, especially on the defensive side of the ball. DeMarcus Lawrence open the game with a fumble return for a TD. Tony Pollard and Ezekiel Elliott rushed for a combined 164 yards. They didn&rsquo;t need much from Cooper Rush, who threw for just 102 yards. For the Rams, Matthew Stafford had little protection, threw a pick and lost two fumbles. The bigger concern for the Rams is their offensive line, but also Cooper Kupp (foot) and DT Aaron Donald (foot), who didn&rsquo;t practice on Wednesday but are expected to play on Sunday. Dallas star LB Micah Parsons (groin) is also not practicing but is expected to be ready to play.</p><p><strong>ARIZONA (+5.5) over Philadelphia 17-20</strong></p><p>So the Eagles won but didn&rsquo;t cover as Cameron Dicker nailed a late field goal. He was just signed to the practice squad last Tuesday as Jake Elliott was sidelined with an ankle injury. Arizona wound up with Matt Amendola, who missed a 43-yard field to with 22 seconds left to win the game. He was also signed last week to replace Matt Prater (hip). Arizona falls to 0-3 at home and has not won there since late October of 2021. The Cards are not getting much from their running game as James Conner (55 yds) injured his ankle and is not expected to play this week. Jalen Hurts threw for 239 yards and ran for 61 yards with two TDs to help keep the Eagles undefeated. Good news for Arizona is that WR DeAndre Hopkins will be sitting out one more game due to a suspension and return in Game 7. The Eagles are banged up on the offensive line with C Jason Kelce (ankle) and C Landon Dickerson (leg) listed as questionable, though LT Jordan Mailata (shoulder) is expected to return this week.</p><p><strong>Cincinnati (+3.5) over BALTIMORE 17-19</strong></p><p>The Ravens didn&rsquo;t cover, but finally won their first home game of the season and had lost five straight. It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty game by either offense as Lamar Jackson threw for just 174 yards with a TD and a pick. He also ran for 58 yards and helped them get into FG range for Justin Tucker to nail a 43-yarder as time expired. His weapons have diminished as WR Rashod Bateman (foot) is likely to miss another game this week. Cincy ran for 101 yards and threw for just 190 against the league&rsquo;s 32nd-ranked pass defense. That pass defense appears to be getting better. Joe Burrow threw for 217 yards with a TD and a pick. But they lost WR Tee Higgins (ankle) early in the game and he&rsquo;s listed as questionable. He wasn&rsquo;t even in uniform in Thursday&rsquo;s practice.</p><p><strong>Monday, October 10, 2022</strong></p><p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders (+7.5) over KANSAS CITY 29-30</strong></p><p>The Raiders covered this game, but they had a chance to win it if Davante Adams and Hunter Renfro hadn&rsquo;t collided into one another on a last-second fourth-and-one play. Josh McDaniels had to be questioned for not running the football with Josh Jacobs (154 yds, 1 TD) on third and fourth-and-one. He also went for two with 4:27 left down one, though that made more sense considering the fact that they didn&rsquo;t want to give Patrick Mahomes the ball back in a tied game. Mahomes was his typical self with 292 passing yards and four TDs, all to TE Travis Kelce. This was another game where a big DL (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34772852/chiefs-baffled-roughing-passer-penalty-chris-jones">Chris Jones</a>) was called for a very questionable roughing the passer penalty against Derek Carr, late in the first half. Good news for the Chiefs is that Harrison Butker (ankle) is finally expected to play. The Raiders lost TE Darren Waller (hamstring) early in the game. Fortunately, the Raiders have a bye week so he&rsquo;ll have an extra week to rest.</p>
