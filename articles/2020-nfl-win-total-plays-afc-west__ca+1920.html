                        <p>The 2020 NFL season is still expected to start on time, which is September 10th. Let&rsquo;s all hope that it plays out as expected. Let&rsquo;s hope that it begins on time and that they are able to play out the entire season. The NFL Schedule was released a couple of months ago and so I have been going over the Win Totals for each team, by division. Today I will tackle the AFC West and below you can find the other win total previews I have done so far.</p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-totals-nfc-east__ca+1906.html">NFC East</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-north__ca+1907.html">NFC North</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-south__ca+1908.html">NFC South</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-west__ca+1915.html">NFC West</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-east__ca+1917.html">AFC East</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-north__ca+1918.html">AFC North</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-south__ca+1919.html">AFC South</a></p><p><br />All Win Totals & Odds Are Courtesy Of <a href="https://www.betonline.ag/sportsbook/futures-and-props/nfl-team-wins">Betonline.ag</a></p><p><br /><strong>Denver Broncos</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 7.5 (-135), Under 7.5 (+105)</strong></p><p>The Denver Broncos finished in 2nd place in the AFC West but they were sj\till just 7-9 on the year. Denver is hoping for a better season this year but even if they do have one, it will not be enough to knock the Chiefs off the top rung. The Broncos needed help with their offense and they got it by taking wide receivers Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler with their first two picks in the draft. This is Drew Lock&rsquo;s team now after Joe Flacco has departed for the Big Apple. Lock played in five games last year which will give him some experience but the shortened preseason could hurt him some here. The running game is in good hand with the trio of Phillip Lindsay, Melvin Gordon, and Royce Freeman. The defense was middle of the pack last year and it should be better this year, especially with trade acquisitions CB A.J. Bouye and defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, along with 3rd round pick CB Michael Ojemudia. This is an improved team on both sides of the ball but the problem for the Broncos will come by having to tackle a very tough schedule. At home, they must face Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Miami, Kansas City, LA Chargers, New Orleans, Buffalo, and Las Vegas. At the very best, Denver will score just four wins against that slate. On the road, they have games at Pittsburgh, the NY Jets, New England, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Kansas City, Carolina, and the Chargers. I&rsquo;ve looked over that many times and just can&rsquo;t see more than three wins on the road. They may even win just two (Jets & Panthers). Denver is still a year away from challenging in the West. <strong>Prediction: Denver Under 7.5 (+105)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Kansas City Chiefs</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 11.5 (-145), Under 11.5 (+115)</strong></p><p>The Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year and they are the favorites to do so again this year. The main core of the team is still intact and the offense will again be among the best in the league. Patrick Mahomes won league MVP last year and he is primed to have another big season. Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins are big hitters in the passing game while Travis Kelce may be the best TE in the league. He led the team with 1227 yards and five Tds a year ago. The ground game needed a boost and they got it by drafting RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the first round. This could be a more rounded offensive team but still, throwing the ball is their main offensive threat. The defense was decent last year and it will be good again. Drafting LB Willie Gay Jr. in the 3rd round will give a boost to the defense but they still could use an edge rusher, especially with the loss of DE Emmanuel Ogbah to the Dolphins. The Chiefs have home games against Houston, New England, Las Vegas, the Jets, Carolina, Denver, Atlanta, and the Chargers. I will look for one, maybe two losses there. Their last two games of the season are home against the Falcons and Chargers and KC could very well have the division wrapped up by then and that could allow them to rest players, which means a loss in one of those two games. On the road, they will face the Chargers, Ravens, Buffalo, Denver, Las Vegas, Tampa Bay, Miami, and New Orleans. That is a tough schedule and I will look for them to go just 4-4 away from home. KC may be a bit better overall than last year but they are coming off a super bowl win, will have a shortened preseason, and will end up with just 11 wins this year. <strong>Prediction: Kansas City Under 11.5 (+105)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Las Vegas Raiders</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 7.5 (-105), Under 7.5 (-125)</strong></p><p>First off, I have to get used to calling them the Las Vegas Raiders. LOL. Ok, now that we have that out of the way. The Raiders went just 7-9 last year but they should be a better team this year. The fun battle will be to see if Marcus Mariota or Derek Carr score the starting QB slot. I feel it will be Carr, but having Mariota as a backup is not a bad thing for John Gruden. Whoever wins the job, they should have plenty of weapons to throw to as the Raiders used three of their first four picks in the draft on receivers. They also brought in Nelson Agholor from the Eagles, plus they still have TE Darren Waller, who led the team in receiving last year. The ground game is set with Josh Jacobs, who had 1150 yards rushing last year. This should be a more dynamic offense than the one that averaged just 19.6 ppg a year ago. The defense was not that great and the loss of LB Vontez Burfict will not help. Still, the defense should be better. Las Vegas used their 2nd first-round pick on CB Damon Arnette and they also brought in CB Prince Amukamara, LB Corey Littleton, LB LB Nick Kwaitkowski, and DE Karl Nassib to help out on that side of the ball. At home, the Raiders will be facing New Orleans, Buffalo, Tampa Bay, Denver, Kansas City, Indianapolis, the Chargers and Dolphins. That is a tough slate, for the most part, but they should be able to squeeze out at least five wins. On the road, they have games against Carolina, New England, Kansas City, Cleveland, LA Chargers, Atlanta, New York Jets, and Denver. I feel that they can get three wins from that slate. Jon Gruden is an excellent coach and the Raiders have improved on both sides of the ball, so I will call for them to bag at least eight wins this year. <strong>Prediction: Las Vegas Over 7.5 (-105)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Los Angeles Chargers</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 7.5 (-145), Under 7.5 (+115)</strong></p><p>As odd as it will be to say the Las Vegas Raiders, it will be just as odd to watch a Chargers game without Philip Rivers under center. Rivers is a true iron man as he started all 16 games the last 14 years in a row. Now the reigns will be turned over to Justin Herbert, who the Bolts took with the 6th overall pick in the draft. With a shortened preseason, we may not see him start the year as the number one guy. That distinction should go to Tyrod Taylor. Whoever is the QB at the start of the year, they will have plenty of weapons to throw to, including Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, and Hunter Henry. They also drafted KJ hill in the 7th round and joe reed in the 5th round. The ground game took a hit with the loss of Melvin Gordon but Austin Ekeler is more than capable of putting up big yards, plus they drafted RB Joshua Kelley in the 4th round. Do not sleep on this offense, especially once Herbert takes over. The defense was very solid last year and should be better this year. They took LB Kenneth Murray in the first round and also brought in DT Linval Joseph, CB Chris Harris, and OLB Nick Vigil through free agency. Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at the schedule. You have to wonder if the Bolts will play better at home without as many fans in the stands. Still, they may actually have some of their own fans this year now that they are playing in a new stadium. At home, the Bolts will face the Chiefs, Panthers, Jets, Jags, Raiders, Patriots, Falcons and Broncos. I can surely see them winning five of those games. On the road, they will face Cincinnati, Tampa Bay, New Orleans, Miami, Denver, Buffalo, Las Vegas, and Kansas City. As hard as I tried, I cannot see the Bolts putting up more than two wins on the road. They are my team but still, I see LA going just 7-9 this year. <strong>Prediction: Los Angeles Under 7.5 (+115)</strong></p>
