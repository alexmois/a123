                        <p>UFC Fight Night 172 Results</p><p>By Scott Reichel</p><p><strong>Marlon Vera vs. Song Yadong</strong></p><p><strong>Result: Yadong Via Unanimous Decision</strong></p><p>Summary:Round one starts with Yadong landing a couple of strikes as both fighters patiently keep their distance. Both fighters start to exchange leg kicks without either fighter doing much damage. Both fighters also take turns controlling the center of the Octagon in this pretty uneventful round. Song and Vera switch off pinning each other against the cage in the clinch for the last minute until the bell sounds. Tough round to score but I give a slight lean to Yadong. Round two starts with both fighters looking a lot more active as they each land a few strikes. Yadong lands a couple of small punching combos while Vera responds with a few small kicks. Both fighters continue to trade in the standup with Yadong showing a bit more in terms of volume. They continue to throw heavy shots up against the cage before separating and returning to the center of the Octagon before the round ends. Very similar round to the first one but I think it is probably tied going into the third. Vera charges at the start of round three and Song quickly gets him in the clinch up against the fence. Vera reverses it and gets a takedown. Vera tries to work quickly but Yadong gets back to his feet. Both fighters start to trade once again in the standup but Yadong is getting a clear edge in these exchanges. Vera manages to get Yadong up against the fence and gets another takedown. Yadong gets up and both fighters continue to swing. Yadong shoots for a takedown and gets reversed. He manages to get back up and the bell sounds. Very tough fight to score but I think Vera squeaked it out. Probably going to be a split decision.</p><p><strong>Eryk Anders vs. Krzysztof Jotko</strong></p><p><strong>Result: Jotko Via Unanimous Decision</strong></p><p>Summary: This fight starts with Jotko landing several leg kicks while keeping his distance. Anders continues to circle without really doing much. Both fighters trade heavy punches against the fence before Anders gets a brief takedown. Jotko gets up and Anders pushes him back up against the fence. Jotko breaks free once again and Anders starts to move forward a bit and both fighters take turns in the clinch before the bell sounds. Tough round to score but Anders landed a few more damaging strikes so I think that he should get the round. Round two starts with both fighters missing on some heavy shots. Jotko lands a big left but Anders shakes it off and pushes Jotko up against the cage once again. Jotko breaks away and hits Anders with a knee. Anders shakes it off again and both fighters patiently look for an opening. Anders pushes him back up against the fence and fails on a few takedown attempts before the round ends. Round three starts and Anders pushes Jotko up against the fence once again before both fighters separate once again. Both fighters continue to struggle landing strikes before Anders lands a decent combination. Jotko lands another big left hand before Anders pushes him back up against the fence before both of them separate again. After both fighters miss on a few strikes, Anders pushes Jotko up against the cage and they separate right before the bell sounds. Easily the worst fight on the card but I think Jotko did enough to win the last two rounds.</p><p><strong>Edson Barboza vs. Dan Ige</strong></p><p><strong>Result: Dan Ige Via Split Decision</strong></p><p>Summary: In round one, Ige starts out fast before Barboza gets a brief knockdown with a right hand. Barboza jumps on top as Ige moves into the full guard. Barboza throws a couple of hammerfists before Ige gets back to his feet. Ige lands a few strikes as Barboza slightly retreats. Barboza lands a leg kick and then connects with a strong left. Ige keeps moving forward without making much progress and both fighters start to circle each other patiently. Both fighters do not really do anything else for the last 40 seconds and the bell sounds. Round two starts with Ige landing an impressive punch combination. Ige continues to move forward and lands a leg kick. Barboza lands a leg kick and takes a few more punches before getting pushed up against the fence. Both fighters break and Ige lands a punch that wobbles Barboza a bit. Barboza is starting to bleed around his nose and Ige continues to push forward. Ige shoots for a takedown and Barboza stuffs it. Barboza hits Ige with a kick to the body and Ige tries for another takedown which gets stuffed again. Barboza finishes the round on top but I think that it is tied going into the third round. In round three, both fighters trade brief strikes without either fighter gaining much of an advantage. Ige keeps trying to land a knockout punch but cannot connect. Barboza lands a knee to the body and Ige fails with his takedown attempt. Ige continues to stalk Barboza in pursuit of a huge strike but keeps missing before finally landing a takedown. Barboza goes into full guard as Ige maintains top position for the last 40 seconds before the bell sounds. This fight is very close. Barboza clearly one the first round while Ige clearly won the third round. I personally think that Ige did enough to win the second round and, therefore, the fight but I expect a split decision.</p><p><strong>Claudia Gadelha vs. Angela Hill</strong></p><p><strong>Result: Gadelha Via Split Decision</strong></p><p>Summary: Both fighters come out and exchange some strikes without any fighter getting an advantage before Gadelha pushes Hill up against the fence. Gadelha continues to hold her against the fence before finally getting a takedown. Gadelha sits on top of her and lands some big shots over the final minute until the round is over. Round two starts and Hill lands a few big shots early as Gadelha briefly hits the ground before Hill lets her get back up. Both fighters continue to trade in the standup before Gadelha pushes her opponent back against the fence. Hill reverses it and holds Gadelha in place before they break. Both fighters continue to trade as Gadelha connects with a strong right. Both fighters fail to land anything substantial after that and the round ends with everything coming down to the final five minutes. Round three begins with Gadelha moving forward as both fighters land some strikes. Gadelha lands a strong leg kick before both fighters start to dance around each other. Gadelha lands a strong right and both of them continue to throw constant punches. Hill lands a right punch and Gadelha comes back with a right of her own. Gadelha gets Hill in the clinch up against the fence and Hill breaks free right as Gadelha lands an elbow. Both fighters trade during the final ten seconds and the bell sounds. The first two rounds were obvious and the third round was very close. I personally lean to Gadelha but another split decision seems likely.</p><p><strong>Alistair Overeem vs. Walt Harris</strong></p><p><strong>Result: Overeem Via Second-Round KO</strong></p><p>Summary: Both fighters come out for the first round with Harris being the early aggressor. Overeem keeps retreating before landing a body kick. Harris rocks him as Overeem falls to the ground. Harris keeps smashing Overeem&rsquo;s face. Looks like the ref could have stopped it but Overeem manages to survive. Harris trips and Overeem jumps on top. Overeem continues to lie on top as he starts to punch Harris in the face as he tries to get the full mount. Harris gets back up and the bell sounds. Tough round to score but I give it to Harris since he scored the knockdown. Round two starts out a lot slower as both fighters still look a bit tired from round one. Overeem lands a massive kick to the head which drops Harris and he continues to land shots after taking control of the back. Overeem flattens Harris out and continues to rain punches down on the side of his head. Harris is not defending himself and the ref stops the fight.</p>
