                        <p>One of the most important factors in handicapping NFL preseason games is the backup quarterback. Most starting quarterbacks play very little, if at all during preseason. That&rsquo;s understandable since it&rsquo;s not worth risking an injury to a starter in three-game preseason where wins and losses are irrelevant. In the preseason, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand the quarterback rotations and how much each will play, which can be found in local newspapers and blogs. But knowledge of the quality of the backup quarterbacks is just as important.</p><p>Here is a current list of quarterback rotations for the 2023 season along with an analysis.</p><p><h4 class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/">Looking for help this football season or in the preseason? Check out our Experts and earn a huge profit!</a></h4></p><p>*-rookie</p><p>NFL Preseason Quarterback Rotations for 2023</p><p>AFC East</p><p>Buffalo Bills: Josh Allen, Kyle Allen, Matt Barkley</p><p>There&rsquo;s no reason to play Josh Allen, who would end up either getting hurt or hurting someone when he runs over them. Allen is a solid backup with starting experience, while Barkley will play a lot third and fourth quarters. He is good enough to exploit backups on defense.</p><p>Miami Dolphins: Tua Tagovailoa, Mike White, Skylar Thompson, James Blackman</p><p>Don&rsquo;t expect Tua to play in preseason. He&rsquo;s the franchise and they need to keep him health. White at least has starting experience with the Jets, while Thompson did play as a rookie in last season&rsquo;s playoff loss to Buffalo.</p><p>New England Patriots: Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Trace McSorley, *Malik Cunningham</p><p>Another year, another new playcaller as Bill O&rsquo;Brien returns as the OC. Jones should play very little in the preseason. Zappe is a Bill Belichick favorite who can mentor Jones and is a solid backup. Zappe was a fourth-round pick who will battle Trace McSorley for the backup job. Malik Cunningham, a rookie from Louisville, could get some time as well.</p><p>New York Jets: Aaron Rodgers, Zach Wilson, Tim Boyle, Chris Steveler</p><p>Aaron Rodgers will be holding a lot of clipboards and I-Pads in the preseason. Wilson needs to improve as a passer or he&rsquo;ll be out of the league shortly. Boyle was a former backup to Rodgers at Green Bay and could beat Wilson out if he has a strong preseason.</p><p>AFC North</p><p>Baltimore Ravens: Lamar Jackson, Tyler Huntley, Josh Johnson, Anthony Brown</p><p>Jackson just signed a $260 million contract extension and will likely not play in the preseason. With new OC Todd Monken, he could be looking at a new backup since Tyler Huntley was more of a Greg Roman guy. Veteran Josh Johnson is in the mix, while Anthony Brown could be showing his skills for another team.</p><p>Cincinnati Bengals: Joe Burrow, Trevor Siemian, Jake Browning,</p><p>Last year, Joe Burrow was coming off an appendectomy and this year, it&rsquo;s a calf strain. He wasn&rsquo;t going to play anyhow and this is all about Siemian, who has starting experience with the Jets, Denver, New Orleans and the Bears. Browning spent two seasons on Minnesota&rsquo;s practice squad and he&rsquo;ll likely be the third-string.</p><p>Cleveland Browns: Deshaun Watson, Josh Dobbs, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, Kellen Monday</p><p>Watson was very rusty last preseason and if he plays this year, it will be minimally. They did re-sign Dobbs with Jacob Brissett now off to Washington. Rookie Thompson-Robinson will get a good look in camp.</p><p>Pittsburgh Steelers: Kenny Pickett, Mitchell Trubisky, Mason Rudolph,</p><p>When you look at a preseason roster, it&rsquo;s always good to have experienced quarterbacks. Pittsburgh has that in Trubisky and Rudolph. Pickett now is the guy, so once again, he probably won&rsquo;t play. Trubisky is making a lot for a backup so if somebody else in the league goes down, he could be trade bait. Rudolph could be an adequate backup, who needs to show he can play in this league.</p><p>AFC South</p><p>Houston Texans: *C.J. Stroud, Davis Mills, Case Keenum</p><p>When you&rsquo;re betting preseason, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing to have a rookie quarterback, but he usually needs the reps. Stroud has had his ups and downs early on, so expect him to play some. Mills completed 66.8% of his passes for 2,664 yards as a rookie and then threw for 3,118 yards last season. But he also amassed just 17 TDs and 15 picks. Keenum could push him as the backup and might be the best quarterback on the roster in terms of being ready to play.</p><p>Indianapolis Colts: *Anthony Richardson, Gardner Minshew, Sam Ehlinger</p><p>In terms of preseason, this is a very good quarterback trio. Richardson is raw and will get some reps. Minshew has started 24 games, but was just 8-16 in those games. Ehlinger, who as marginal last season as a starter, but at least has some reps. But this preseason is all about Richardson and him getting accustomed to the NFL.</p><p>Jacksonville Jaguars: Trevor Lawrence, C.J. Beathard, Nathan Rourke</p><p>Lawrence shouldn&rsquo;t play in the preseason as he played in every game last season and threw for 25 TDs and 8 INTs.. Beathard is not a great quarterback by any means, but he&rsquo;s had some experience with the 49ers, throwing for over 3,400 yards with 18 TDs and 13 INT in 2021. Rourke is a journeyman from the CFL, who is there as a camp arm.</p><p>Tennessee Titans: Ryan Tannehill, *Will Levis, Malik Willis</p><p>This is another situation where you have a veteran quarterback in Tannehill, who doesn&rsquo;t need to play in the preseason and is probably in his last season as the starter. Will Levis is a second-round pick with a big arm and could be the future. He&rsquo;ll definitely play a lot in preseason. Last year&rsquo;s third-round pick Malik Willis does need to play as well after a very disappointing rookie season.</p><p>AFC West</p><p>Denver Broncos: Russell Wilson, Jarrett Stidham, Ben DiNucci</p><p>Russell Wilson struggled with Nathaniel Hackett last season, but new coach Sean Payton should be a much better fit. Wilson doesn&rsquo;t need to play in preseason. Stidham is a talented passer who should be the backup and will play a lot. DiNucci has some experience and is just trying to make an NFL roster.</p><p>Kansas City Chiefs: Patrick Mahomes, Blaine Gabbert, Shane Buechele, Chris Oladokun</p><p>Mahomes won his second Super Bowl so there&rsquo;s nothing to prove. Chad Henne has retired which means veteran Blain Gabbert should be fine in his role after caddying for Tom Brady in Tampa Bay. Buechele has some tools and could be in the mix for the backup job.</p><p>Las Vegas Raiders: Jimmy Garoppolo, Brian Hoyer, *Aidan O&rsquo;Connell</p><p>Derek Carr is gone to New Orleans so enter Jimmy G. He won&rsquo;t play or at least shouldn&rsquo;t due to injury issues. Hoyer is a solid backup, who knows what Josh McDaniels wants in a backup. Keep an eye on O&rsquo;Connell, the gunslinger from Purdue, who has potential.</p><p>Los Angeles Chargers: Justin Herbert, Easton Stick, Max Duggan</p><p>Herbert doesn&rsquo;t need to prove anything in preseason and now has a big contract. Easton Stick and rookie Max Duggan, who was Mr. Irrelevant, will battle for the backup job. They also will play a lot in the preseason, which is not necessarily a good thing.</p><p>NFC East</p><p>Dallas Cowboys: Dak Prescott, Cooper Rush, Will Grier</p><p>Prescott doesn&rsquo;t need to play at all. Rush had a win as a backup two seasons ago and is 5-1 as a starter. Grier did see time with the Panthers in 2019 and threw for 229 yards, but had no TDs and four picks. He&rsquo;s basically a camp arm.</p><p>New York Giants: Daniel Jones, Tyrod Taylor, Tommy DeVito</p><p>This is a very good quarterback situation-for preseason. Jones proved that he could be a franchise-type of quarterback last year and was rewarded for it. Taylor is one of the better backup quarterbacks in football and can start. DeVito is more of a developmental prospect.</p><p>Philadelphia Eagles: Jalen Hurts, Marcus Mariota, *Tanner McKee</p><p>Here&rsquo;s another pretty good quarterback room. Hurts doesn&rsquo;t need preseason after leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl appearance last season. Mariota should be a very good backup, but he&rsquo;s not a very good starter. He does many of the same things as Hurts, but just not as well. McKee is a sixth-round pick from Stanford with a strong arm.</p><p>Washington Commanders: Sam Howell, Jacoby Brissett, Jake Fromm</p><p>Howell had just one start last season as a rookie, but it was good enough that he will likely be the starter. He also needs some reps so he should play in preseason. Brissett is a very capable backup who can start. Fromm is basically a camp arm, but this is a good situation for preseason bettors.</p><p>NFC North</p><p>Chicago Bears: Justin Fields, P.J. Walker, Nathan Peterman, *Tyson Bagent</p><p>Fields should have a big year with the addition of D.J. Moore as the top receiver. He doesn&rsquo;t need preseason. Walker has some of the same skill sets as Fields and has some starting experience at Carolina, which should help in preseason. Peterman was a bad starter, but at least has experience as a third-stringer.</p><p>Detroit Lions: Jared Goff, Nate Sudfeld, *Hendon Hooker, *Adrian Martinez</p><p>This is a fun situation with two rookies in the mix. There&rsquo;s no reason to play Goff, who had a solid season in 2022. Hooker is really for the future since he&rsquo;s coming off a torn ACL at Tennessee last season. Sudfeld is the backup because Hooker is still rehabbing his injury. He could be ready to play late in the season if Goff is injured.</p><p>Green Bay Packers Jordan Love, *Sean Clifford, Danny Etling, Alex McGough</p><p>Love takes over as the starter with Aaron Rodgers off to the Jets. He has all the tools to be a very good quarterback and just needs experience. He should play some in the preseason. Rookie Sean Clifford had an pretty good, but inconsistent career at Penn State. He&rsquo;s likely to get the backup job.</p><p>Minnesota Vikings: Kirk Cousins, Nick Mullens, *Jaren Hall</p><p>Cousins won&rsquo;t play much, if at all, in preseason. He just needs to win playoff games. He doesn&rsquo;t have anybody to push him on the roster or replace him if he leaves next season. Mullens Is capable and should be the backup. Hall is a rookie from Minnesota, who is a developmental quarterback.</p><p>NFC South</p><p>Atlanta Falcons: Desmond Ridder, Taylor Heinicke, Logan Woodside</p><p>Desmond Ridder is the starter after he took over for Marcus Mariota last season. He might play some in the preseason, but he&rsquo;s not going to lose his job. Heinicke is a good backup, who can move well and has plenty of starting experience. Woodside has always been a camp arm.</p><p>Carolina Panthers: *Bryce Young, Andy Dalton, Matt Corral</p><p>The Panthers cleaned house at quarterback and traded up to draft Young, a very accurate quarterback. His lack of size is a concern so Frank Reich might want to be careful with him in preseason. Dalton is a very good backup and mentor to have for a young quarterback. Coral was drafted in the third round in 2022 and missed the entire season due to an injury, so he has plenty to prove. He&rsquo;ll likely play in the second half in all three games.</p><p>New Orleans Saints: Derek Carr, Jameis Winston, *Jake Haener</p><p>The addition of Carr should make the Saints contenders in the NFC South. He doesn&rsquo;t need to play in the preseason unless they need him to get accustomed to his new receiver. Winston has always turned the ball over too often. Haener is a rookie from Fresno State, who is a developmental prospect.</p><p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Baker Mayfield, Kyle Trask, John Wolford</p><p>Mayfield takes over at quarterback, assuming he wins the job. This is a pretty good situation and that&rsquo;s a quarterback battle. He&rsquo;ll be pushed by former Florida QB Kyle Trask, who has thrown just nine passes in his career. He&rsquo;ll get plenty of time in preseason along with journeyman John Wolford.</p><p>NFC West</p><p>Arizona Cardinals: Kyler Murray (inj.), Colt McCoy, *Clayton Tune, Jeff Driskel, David Blough</p><p>McCoy is a pretty good backup, but is now the likely starter with Murray out due to a torn ACL suffered in Week 14. There should be a battle between Tune, the rookie from Houston and the veterans Driskel and Blough for the backup job. McCoy has the edge due to experience, but with new coach Jonathan Gannon, he might have his own favorite until Murray returns.</p><p>Los Angeles Rams: Matthew Stafford, *Stetson Bennett, Brett Rypien, *Dresser Winn</p><p>The Rams need a strong backup, because Stafford is now 35 and is coming off a bruised spinal cord. If he gets hurt again, this becomes a rebuilding squad and they basically are coming close to that level. Bennett will get a long look in preseason and while he might not have the prototypical size, he&rsquo;s accurate and wins games. Rypien is another veteran with some starting experience.</p><p>San Francisco 49ers: Brock Purdy, Sam Darnold, Trey Lance</p><p>Purdy came out of nowhere last season to take over as the starter and then suffered a shoulder injury. He&rsquo;s back and takes over as the starter in camp. Darnold and Lance will fight it out for the backup job. That&rsquo;s a pretty good preseason group of quarterbacks as Lance has a lot to prove.</p><p>Seattle Seahawks: Geno Smith, Drew Lock, *Holton Ahlers</p><p>Smith was a revelation last season with 30 TDs and 11 picks. There&rsquo;s no need to play him in preseason. Lock does not play and rookie Ahlers was a four-year starter at East Carolina. He was very productive with 97 TDs, but also had 37 picks.</p>
