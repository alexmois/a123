                        <p>UFC Fight Island 2 completes three Octagon events in seven days from Yas Island, Abu Dhabi.</p><p>The main event offers a flyweight championship rematch between perennial top contender <strong>Joseph Benavidez (+175) and Deiveson Figueiredo (-210).</strong>After winning three straight, including a February TKO of Benavidez, 32-year-old Figueiredo holds inside betting leverage for Saturday&rsquo;s five rounder.</p><p>The Brazilian missed weight at UFC on ESPN + 27 and was unable to claim vacant 125 lb gold. Though, &ldquo;Deus da Guerra&rdquo; came in at 129 pounds that night, it&rsquo;s clear his natural frame is too large for aging Benavidez. It follows logic the younger, stronger, faster Figueiredo holds every advantage against 14-year-vet Benavidez.</p><p>During the pair&rsquo;s first fight, Benavidez outlanded his upcoming opponent 46-25. However, none of &ldquo;Beefcake&rsquo;s&rdquo; usually buzzing punches affected Figueiredo. Instead, the top flyweight contender walked down Benavidez using sheer force to land a game-ending overhand right at 1:54 of round two.</p><p>Long considered among the greatest MMA fighters to never wear the brass ring, Team Alpha Male cornerstone Benavidez is 20-6 vs. WEC and UFC fare. Losing narrow championship split verdicts against Dominick Cruz and Demetrius Johnson, Saturday could mark the final shot at glory for one of the game&rsquo;s pioneer little men.</p><p>At 7-1 within Octagon walls, Figueiredo holds but one signature win, and lost in 2019 against fading Jussier Formiga. However, to join current MMA elite, Deiveson Figueiredo just needs to be a bit better this weekend than depreciating legend Benavidez -and he is.</p><p><strong>The Prediction: Figueiredo by TKO</strong></p><p>Co-main action sees pick em' odds as top-ten middleweights<strong>Jack Hermansson (-110) and Kelvin Gastelum (-110)</strong> wage war.</p><p>Number seven ranked Gastelum owns the bigger name after winning a TUF season and defeating the ghosts of Nate Marquardt, Johny Hendricks, Tim Kennedy, and Michael Bisping. During his 'legend killer' run, Gastelum was tapped by Chris Weidman and became the former 185-pound boss' lone win in six recent tries. Bloated at middleweight, Gastelum has lost consecutive bouts versus Darren Till and Israel Adesanya after eking past then 38-year-old Jacare Souza.<br /><br /></p><p>Jack Hermansson rose to sixth-ranked middleweight status after defeating Souza and three additional name opponents. However, in his last fight the rangy Swede was halted abruptly by red hot Jarod Cannonier. While "The Joker" wields balanced power and grappling, four paid opponents have finished Hermansson within distance.<br /><br />Normally, being stopped that many times would raise concern, though Hermannson's physical advantages over Gastelum allay suspicion.</p><p>Behind stiff jabs and underrated wrestling, expect the best version of Hermansson Saturday as he lands at will vs. 5'8 Gastelum. Outclassed in terms of wrestling, striking and strength, Gastelum faces a nightmare matchup from Fight Island.</p><p><strong>The Prediction: Jack Hermansson by decision</strong></p><p>Bout three has all the makings of Fight of the Night as rejuvenated <strong>Marc Diakiese (-155) faces Rafael Fiziev (+135)</strong>.</p><p>After a gut-check three event win drought, hyper-athletic Diakiese rebounded by defeating quality foes Lando Vannata and Joe Duffy in controlled, impressive fashion belying earlier missteps. Averaging 2.89 lands per minute and 2.23 takedowns per 15 minutes, the peaking 27-year-old is well versed.</p><p>Following his first UFC win, aggressive kickboxer Rafael Fiziev hunts another forward step in his chosen path. Fiziev outlanded Alex White 73-66 recently to avenge a highlight TKO debut Octagon loss vs. Magomed Mustafaev.</p><p>When Diakiese and Fiziev meet, no striking expense will be spared. Though, using his growing fight IQ, "The Bonecrusher" will present enough lateral movement to scoot by hard-charging Rafael Fiziev both standing and wrestling.</p><p><strong>The Prediction: Marc Diakiese by decision</strong></p><p>Fight four gives every appearance of a standup battle between noted strikers <strong>Ariane "The Violence Queen" Lipski (-120) and Luana Carolina (+100).</strong></p><p>Lipski lost some of her overseas shine while dropping her initial Octagon offerings against Joanne Calderwood and Molly McCann. Undaunted, Lipski blazed through veteran Isabela De Pauda recently to earn a first UFC victory. Overall, the Brazilian lands 3.53 strikes per minute.</p><p>With a style perhaps tailor-made for her upcoming opponent, fellow Brazilian Carolina defeated Priscilla Cachoeira in June 2019 using a wicked Thai clench. The 27-year-old is 1-0 at the highest level following a successful DWCS cameo.<br /><br /></p><p>Again, however, styles make fights. And after proving her wares pre-UFC, "The Violence Queen" will use greater experience to brush past her countrywoman.</p><p><strong>The Prediction: Ariane Lipski by decision</strong></p><p><strong>Flyweight contenders Askar Askarov (+170) and Alexandre Pantoja (-200)</strong>open UFC Fight Island 2 searching for an elusive title opportunity.<br /><br />Slated as the championship standby for the latest Fight Island installment, proven finisher Alexandre Pantoja welcomes quality opposition after blitzing four of five opponents. Pantoja's lone defeat in that stretch came vs. title favorite Figueiredo.</p><p>Meanwhile, Askarov overpowered Tim Elliot recently after fighting standout Brandon Moreno to a draw. The Russian born fighter is unbeaten through 12 career starts.</p><p>In an absolute firefight to open main card action, the only element stopping Askarov from downing Pantoja is the latter's big-game experience. Similar to how Jimmie Rivera edged Cody Stamman, Alexandre "The Cannibal" Pantoja will keep his blue-chip opponent at bay through 15 minutes using varied styles and angles.</p><p><strong>The Prediction: Alexandre Pantoja by decision</strong></p><p>Every main card needs an exciting lead in. The following are undercard picks for UFC Fight Island 2.</p><p>Roman Dolidze (-170) TKO win vs. Khadis Ibravimov (+150)</p><p>Grant Dawson (-255) stoppage win vs. Nad Niramani (+215)</p><p>Joe Duffy (-345) decision win vs. Joel Alvarez (+285)</p><p>Montel Jackson (-200) decision win vs. Brett Johns (+170)</p><p>Malcolm Gordon (+145) decision win vs. Amir Albazi (-165)</p><p>Arman Tsarukyan (-200) stoppage win vs. Davi Ramos (+170)</p><p>Serghei Spivak (-160) submission win vs. Carlos Felipe (+140)</p><p>Odds courtesy of <strong>BestFightOdds.com</strong></p>
