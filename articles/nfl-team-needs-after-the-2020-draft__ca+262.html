                    <div class="copy my-3">
                        <p>Here is a list of all 32 teams and their needs before training camp (whenever that will be).</p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals:</strong></p><p>Current Needs: Edge, WR, TE</p><p>Arizona added an elite linebacker in Isaiah Simmons and a quality offensive lineman in Josh Jones. They still could use a young wide receiver despite picking up DeAndre Hopkins in the offseason. Larry Fitzgerald could go on forever, but this could be his last season. They also could really use an Edge rusher, something they didn't address in the raft. They added two defensive tackles in the fourth round in Leki Fotu and Rashard Lawrence, but no outside linebacker.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Falcons:</strong></p><p>Current Needs: Edge, RB, QB</p><p>The Falcons needed an Edge rusher and didn't address that in the draft. Adding A.J. Terrell in the first round was to address their need with Desmond Trufant getting cut. They had just 28 sacks last season, so even though they added a rookie corner, they need to continue to improve the pass rush. Adding Dante Fowler should help a bit. They also needed a running back, even though Todd Gurley signed with the team in the offseason. The also didn't address the quarterback situation and there may not be a need right now. But Matt Ryan will be 35 during the season and while he's not slowing down, you never know when the decline will start.</p><p><strong>Baltimore Ravens:</strong></p><p>Current Needs: Edge, S</p><p>The Ravens addressed most of their needs in the draft, but they didn't draft an edge rusher or sign one in free agency. They led the league in blitzing, because they couldn't get consistent pressure from the perimeter or interior. Considering Earl Thomas' age and decline, they could have used a young safety to develop. They drafted Geno Stone, a safety from Iowa, in the seventh round.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bills:</strong></p><p>Current Needs: CB, OLB</p><p>The Bills solved one of their needs by trading for Stefon Diggs before the draft. They still could use help at cornerback as they didn't take one until the seventh round with Dane Jackson. They can also use some help at outside linebacker as A.J. Espenesa is more of a 4-3 defensive end.</p><p><strong>Carolina Panthers:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: LB, OG, QB, WR</p><p>The Panthers signed Teddy Bridgewater in the offseason, but he's had a serious knee injury. If he gets hurt, they have to go to second-year quarterback Will Grier, who struggled as a rookie. They did sign XFL quarterback P.J. Walker as a potential backup. They also needed a linebacker with Luke Kuechly retiring. They did not address that in the draft and did not sign his replacement in the offseason. They did sign Robby Anderson, so they are decent at the receiver position with D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel. They also need a center or an interior offensive lineman.</p><p><strong>Chicago Bears:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, S, OL, Edge, QB</p><p>One thing the Bears don't need is a tight end. They have too many after signing 33-year old Jimmy Graham and drafting Cole Kmet with their top pick (2nd round). They didn't draft an offensive tackle until the seventh round and also didn't address that in free agency. They drafted two corners, but didn't draft a safety to replace Ha Ha Clinton Dix. They hope that Trevis Gipson in the fifth round can help as an Edge Rusher.</p><p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, Edge, OL</p><p>Aside from quarterback, the Bengals really needed an offensive tackle. It's a bit puzzling that they didn't draft one until the sixth round. The hope is that Jonah Williams, last year's top pick, will be healthy and protect Joe Burrow's blindside. Adding one in free agency as insurance is not a bad thing. They also need help on the Edge, which is something they really haven't addressed either in the draft or in free agency.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Browns:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: G, OT depth</p><p>After the draft, the Browns are getting close to becoming a complete team. The only question is whether quarterback Baker Mayfield is good enough to lead them to the playoffs. They did sign Jack Conklin, who played right tackle for the Titans last year and drafted left tackle Jedrick Wills with the 10th pick. The issue here is that Wills played right tackle and Alabama and would have to move to left tackle. However, he did protect Tua Tagovailoa's blindside, since he was a southpaw. With Greg Robinson probably not returning, Wills will likely start at left tackle.</p><p><strong>Dallas Cowboys:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: S, TE, CB</p><p>Dallas had a pretty good draft. They did sign S Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, who has become a journeyman. They didn't address that position in that draft and ultimately need an upgrade. At tight end, the Cowboys lost Jason Witten to the Raiders and could also use more talent and speed there. At cornerback, Trevon Diggs has some talent and they also drafted Reggie Robinson in the fourth round. But will they be ready to take over for Byron Jones?</p><p><strong>Denver Broncos:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, LB</p><p>It's hard to find too much fault with John Elway's draft. But when you look at the trouble that Garrett Bolles has had at left tackle with penalty flags, that is a position that Denver still needs to address in the offseason. They also can use some help at linebacker. They drafted two outside linebackers late in the draft, but haven't sign a linebacker as a free agent to this point.</p><p><strong>Detroit Lions:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: Edge, DL, QB</p><p>Matthew Stafford is 32 and still in his prime, but they could use a better backup than Chase Daniel. It was a bit surprising that they didn't take a developmental quarterback at some point in the draft. They did draft Julian Okwara from Notre Dame in the third round, but still could use some help as the Lions ranked 29th in sacks last season. Okwara might be more inside than outside defensive end. They also could have used help on the defensive line, even though they did sign Danny Shelton as a free agent.</p><p><strong>Green Bay Packers:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: WR, OL</p><p>The Packers shocked the world by not only taking Jordan Love in the first round, but by not taking a wide receiver. The thought process is that they have a pretty good group of young receivers aside from Davante Adams, but not are really proven. They did sign Devin Funchess, who if healthy, could be a serviceable number two receiver. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga is gone, so they are hoping that Rick Wagner, a free agent, can fill the hole. If not, they could turn to one of their sixth-round picks including Jon Runyan from Michigan.</p><p><strong>Houston Texans:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: S, OL, RB</p><p>The Texans traded DeAndre Hopkins away and to their credit, acquired Brandin Cooks and Randall Cobb to replace him. Neither is Hopkins, but at least they have some tools on offense for Deshaun Watson. Defensively, they need safety help and didn't address that in the draft or free agency. They could also use some help at guard as both starters improved the team's pass blocking, but struggled as run blockers.</p><p><strong>Indianapolis Colts:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: CB, TE, OL, QB</p><p>The Colts did sign Xavier Rhodes, who was coming off a subpar season with Minnesota. They didn't draft a corner until the sixth round, so that's still concern. This was a weak draft for tight ends, but they could use an upgrade of talent at that position. The offensive line could always use some help and they only took one in the fifth round. With Philip Rivers near the end of the line, they did take Jacob Eason in the fourth round. But if they trade Jacoby Brissett, they'll need a more experienced backup.</p><p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: QB, S</p><p>The Jags had a strong draft and addressed most of their needs. They even drafted a quarterback late, just as they did last season with Gardner Minshew. Jake Luton is not ready to take over if Minshew gest injured and there are still questions about whether he's the answer. They didn't take a safety until the fifth round and could use some help there. Another concern is whether Yannick Ngakoue will ever play for the team. Fortunately, they did draft DE K'Lavon Chaisson with their second first-round pick.</p><p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: CB, IOL, Edge, IDL</p><p>Chiefs did re-sign CB Bashaud Breeland, who got into some trouble on Tuesday. He already facing a four-game suspension for another violation of a substance issue. They did not draft a cornerback in the draft, so that's still a bit of a concern. That and an Edge rusher and basically everything else on defense. They took a chance on Willie Gay Jr. in the second round, who has a red flag or two, but is very talented. Defensive line help is also key, though they did re-sign Chris Jones, which was a huge move.</p><p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: IDL, Edge, QB, S</p><p>The Raiders had quite an interesting draft. They did not address the defensive line in the draft. They did add DE Carl Nassib in free agency, but still can use help. They also need a quarterback even though they signed Marcus Mariota. They basically have two average starting quarterbacks in Mariota and Derek Carr. They did draft a safety in the third round in Tanner Muse, but he's more of a hybrid-type.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Chargers:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, CB, IOL, WR</p><p>The Chargers took Justin Herbert with the sixth pick and everything else seems to be secondary. But they could use some offensive tackle help as Tyrod Taylor is athletic, but small. They did not draft an offensive lineman, which was surprising. They did pick up veteran RT Bryan Bulaga, which will help in the short term. Adding another receiver couldn't hurt, even though they took one in the fifth round.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Rams:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, LB, IOL, DL</p><p>The Rams were busy in the offseason, but one thing they didn't address was adding an offensive tackle. That was a surprise considering Andrew Whitworth is 38. There were some very good tackles in the draft, but the Rams had two second-round picks. They decided to go with a running back in Cam Akers and a wide receiver in Van Jefferson, passing on some talented players. Defensively, the Rams also needed help on the interior of the defensive line. They did re-sign Michael Brockers, after it appeared he was headed to the Ravens. But that still will be a need in terms of depth.</p><p><strong>Miami Dolphins:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: S, WR, Edge</p><p>The key for the Fins was getting a quarterback and they achieved that by getting Tua Tagovailoa. Miami was able to address many needs and they certainly had a ton. They needed some safety help and couldn't really add one until the third round with Brandon Jones. Now they could also use some receiving help as they didn't draft one until the seventh round. They did add some Edge help in free agency, especially with the addition of Shaq Lawson from Buffalo and Emmanuel Ogbah from the Chiefs. Neither is a star, so they still need help there. Drafting Curtis Weaver from Boise State in the fifth round was a steal.</p><p><strong>Minnesota Vikings:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: Edge, S, DL</p><p>With 15 picks, you would think that Minnesota would solve all their needs. They still need some help with the pass rush and didn't really get an Edge rusher. They had six picks in the 6-7 rounds, so most of those are not likely to make the regular roster. They also need some depth at safety, though fortunately placed the franchise tag on Anthony Harris. That signifies they may not be able to keep him next season. The defensive line is another need, though they did grab James Lynch from Bayor in the fourth round.</p><p><strong>New England Patriots:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: QB, WR, DL, TE</p><p>The biggest need right now is a quarterback and the Patriots did not either sign one in free agency or draft one. Well, they did sign Brian Hoyer, but he's not a starting quarterback. That will be Jarrett Stidham, as it appears that the Pats will go with him and not try and pick up a veteran like Cam Newton. As for wide receiver, they've needed one for awhile now. It was even more shocking that they didn't draft a wideout. Losing Danny Shelton was tough for the defensive line. That's another spot that could use an upgrade. Still not convinced that either of the tight ends they drafted in the third round will be the answer.</p><p><strong>New Orleans Saints:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: WR, CB, LB</p><p>The Saints got better defensively and then signed Jameis Winston after the draft. So they may have their future quarterback. At wide receiver, they signed aging wide out Emmanuel Sanders, but didn't address that position in the draft. At cornerback, they could use some depth and young talent. They only had four picks so they couldn't do much. The same could be said about linebacker.</p><p><strong>New York Giants:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: Edge, LB, WR</p><p>The Giants had so many needs. They were able to address the offensive line with two of their first three picks and then take a safety in the second round with Xavier McKinney. They still need help on the Edge, which most teams do. They could really use an elite pass rusher and didn't draft one until the late rounds. They also didn't draft a wide receiver to help Daniel Jones, though they have some talent there with Golden Tate and Sterling Shepard.</p><p><strong>New York Jets:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: Edge, CB, IOL</p><p>Everybody needs a pass rusher. The Jets focused on offense in their first two picks and then went for defense in their next two. They also need some cornerback help, though the addition of Bryan Hall in the fifth round could turn out to be a steal. Offensive line help, especially in the interior, is a definite need. They gave up 52 sacks last season, so it's not just the tackle situation that needs an upgrade.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: CB, LB, OL, Edge</p><p>The Eagles took Jalen Hurts in the second round and that makes a little more sense, considering Carson Wentz's injury issues. But they still need some defensive help including at cornerback, even though they did trade for Darius Slay. That was an excellent deal. At inside linebacker, they took one in the sixth round, so they could use some help. They also need some Edge help, but who doesn't?</p><p><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, QB, TE, DL</p><p>The Steelers had just six picks and made few free agent moves. What they should have done was draft a quarterback, but decided not to. Do they still have faith in Mason Rudolph as the heir apparent to Ben Roethlisberger. They could also use some help at tight end and on the defensive line.</p><p>San Francisco 49ers:</p><p>Current Team Needs: S, CB, IOL</p><p>The 49ers do not need a lot. This is a Super Bowl contender again if they can stay healthy. Safety appears to be the biggest needs in terms of depth. They also need a young cornerback and any cornerback with Richard Sherman getting up there and they also will not be able to re-sign everybody next season. They did not address that in the draft.</p><p><strong>Seattle Seahawks:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: OT, CB, WR</p><p>Seattle didn't draft a receiver until late. They could certainly use help there, even though D.K. Metcalf looks like the real deal. At offensive tackle, Duane Brown is going to be 35 when the season starts. They did not draft one so that's still a need. The secondary can still need some help, especially at corner.</p><p><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: Edge, WR, QB</p><p>Tampa Bay signed Tom Brady, but he can't play forever. They have Blaine Gabbert as the backup, but they don't have a young quarterback to groom. While the receivers are fine, they did lose Breshad Perriman and could use a third wide out. The Edge is a need for them and just about everybody in the league. This wasn't a strong draft for pass rushers and they didn't sing one outside of placing a franchise tag on Shaquil Barrett.</p><p><strong>Tennessee Titans:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: Edge, TE, LB, DL</p><p>The Titans are a few players away and it starts with getting some pass rush help. They didn't address that in the draft. They did basically stay around for the 29th pick in every round and had a steady draft. They could also use a tight end and a linebacker.</p><p><strong>Washington Redskins:</strong></p><p>Current Team Needs: CB, OT, TE, RB</p><p>With Vernon Davis retiring, Washington needs some youth and talent. They didn't address that in the offseason. They could use some offensive line help with Trent Williams headed to San Francisco and there's nobody close to his talent on the roster. They drafted Sahdiq Charles from LSU who is not going to be ready to play yet and is more of a developmental prospect. They could also use a running back who is a difference-maker.</p>
