                        <p><strong>First Round</strong></p><p><strong>1)Cincinnati Bengals, QB Joe Burrow, LSU. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: This guy might not be the next Joe Montana, as the Dolphins believe, but he's extremely accurate. He can move and has good size. He just doesn't have a gun of an arm, but he can read defenses and is smart. Always a learning curve with the NFL and it will take some time with the Bengals.</p><p><strong>2)Washington Redskins, DE Chase Young, Ohio State. Grade: A+</strong></p><p>Comments: Some say Young is the best player in the draft. Isaiah Simmons might argue that, but he's really good. Will be playing for his hometown team (he played at famed DeMatha HS). Not many guys are sure things, but he is. The NFC East has Carson Wentz, Daniel Jones and Dak Prescott who will also have to check on Young pre-snap. The Ohio State has become EDGE-U with the Bosa brothers and now Young.</p><p><strong>3)Detroit Lions-CB Jeff Okudah, Ohio State: Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another Ohio State pick. Burrow played for Ohio State, before transferring to LSU. Slight surprise that the Lions didn't trade this pick. But you can't go wrong with drafting a big, long corner who can play press. There's a big drop-off from Okudah to the next best corner, who many say is C.J. Henderson from Florida. He fills in right away for Darius Slay. Good pick, though you wonder if some in the organization wanted Derrick Brown instead.</p><p><strong>4)New York Giants, OT Andrew Thomas, Georgia. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: First slight surprise here. Many had Thomas behind Tristan Wirfs and Jedrick Wills. This seems like a reach. Solid player with great arm length. Very good pass blocker and can play both sides. Could they have traded down to get him one of the tackles? Would he have gone top 10 had the Giants not taken him? If he becomes a Pro Bowl starter, that won't matter.</p><p><strong>5)Miami Dolphins, QB Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: No shocker here. So all the talk about Miami trading up or down didn't come to fruition (happened later). A lot of talk and little action. Welcome to pre-draft talk. Tua throws a great deep ball and had great receivers around him. Miami better protect him because of all the injuries. Do they play him right away or do they sit him and keep building the team around him?</p><p><strong>6)LA Chargers, QB Justin Herbert, Oregon. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a reach, but the Chargers desperately needed a future starter with Philip Rivers gone. Tyrod Taylor could start for a season so Herbert can learn. Herbert is your prototype 6-6 quarterback with a big arm and some mobility. Holds the ball too long. Smart off the field. Three quarterbacks taken in the first six picks. Has struggled with consistency on deep throws and his touch can be erratic. Nobody is going to doubt his arm strength.</p><p><strong>7)Carolina Panthers, DT Derrick Brown, Auburn. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Panthers got the best defensive tackle in the draft and here is a guy who is smart and disciplined with a father being an Army veteran. Bottom line is that is versatile and consistent. He can play defensive tackle in a 4-3 or defensive end in a 3-4 scheme. Has very long arms and is fast for his size. Not a great pass rusher-yet. Could have gone in top three and it wouldn't have been a bad pick. SEC Defensive Player of the Year. That says something.</p><p><strong>8)Arizona Cardinals, LB Isaiah Simmons, Clemson. Grade: A+</strong></p><p>Comments: Is there a better player in the draft? Maybe Chase Young. Can play inside or outside. Even play safety. Ran a 4.39 40. At 6-4, 238, could get a little bit bigger. Also played corner, but don't see that in the NFL, though maybe he could play slot corner. He's a unique player who doesn't come around too often and very few guys can run at that size. A defensive coordinator's dream. Arizona desperately needed an offensive tackle, but you can't pass up this guy.</p><p><strong>9)Jacksonville Jaguars, CB C.J. Henderson, Florida. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Second-best corner. Not a shocking pick. Good corner, but he's not Okudah. Very talented cover corner, but weak tackler. Surprising since he's 6-1, 204. Needs to get stronger and will struggle with bigger receivers. But this is a solid pick for basically a home-town guy. Needed to replace Jalen Ramsey so a solid pick.</p><p><strong>10)Cleveland Browns, OT Jedrick Wills, Alabama. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good pick. Not a reach for the Browns and they didn't go with a skill position player. Can he play left tackle? Jack Conklin plays right tackle. Wills was arguably the best tackle in the draft. Very good pass protector for Baker Mayfield. Bigger issue is moving to left tackle, which he should be able to do. Grabbing an Alabama offensive lineman is not the worst thing to do.</p><p><strong>11)NY Jets, OT Mekhi Becton, Louisville. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Becton is enormous and can move at 365 pounds. Weight is a bit of a concern and tested positive, so slight red flag. Ran a 5.1 40 at 6-8, 365. Huh? That's incredible. Amazing athlete who can become elite. Not a bad pick and they could have been ok with a wide receiver like Jeudy or Lamb. Will need to take a receiver later in the draft.</p><p><strong>12)Vegas Raiders, WR Henry Ruggs III, Alabama. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Might be the most predictable pick of the draft after the first two. So Raiders. He could be the next Tyreek Hill, but Raiders are gonna Raider. Not as smooth as Jeudy or Lamb. Ran a ridiculous 4.27 40. Also a former basketball player and can fight DBs in the air with a 42-inch vertical. He's a vertical threat to start, but has to work on route-running. If he becomes the next Hill or close to that, this was a good pick.</p><p><strong>13)Tampa Bay (trade with San Francisco), OT Tristan Wirfs, Iowa. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: The Bucs move up one spot to take Tristan Wirfs, a 6-5, 320-pound tackle. They trade a fourth-rounder and their 14th pick and get this pick and a seventh-rounder from the 49ers. Good value and pick up here. He can play left tackle, but would likely play right tackle in Tampa Bay. Still a bit raw but despite that, is really good in pass protection. Moves extremely well and is still getting better. Ran an incredible 4.85 40.</p><p><strong>14)San Francisco 49ers, DT Javon Kinlaw, South Carolina. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Great story as a player who was homeless at one point. Very long arms. Has quick first step. Can play 3-4 defensive end. Good fit since they traded away DeForest Buckner to the Colts. That's where they got this pick, from the Colts. Can also play inside as well. Huge hands and good upper body strength. Could have gone receiver here and would have still been a quality pick, but no problem with Kinlaw.</p><p><strong>15)Denver Broncos, WR Jerry Jeudy, Alabama. Grade: A+</strong></p><p>Comments: Only concern is knee issue in 2018. Great route runner. Smooth. Best pure receiver in the draft and great value with this pick. Average size at 6-1, 193. Needs to get a little bit stronger. Has outstanding hands and ran a 4.4 40, so he can fly even if he's not Ruggs. Put him on the outside or in the slot. Love this pick.</p><p><strong>16)Atlanta Falcons, CB A.J. Terrell, Clemson: Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Terrell had a great 2018 championship game, grabbing a pick-six. Then had trouble in coverage against Clemson in the 2020 title game. Has good recovery speed. Tends to lack consistency and could have issues with penalties if he continues to grab guys at the next level. Good speed at 4.42. Can play press coverage.</p><p><strong>17)Dallas Cowboys, WR CeeDee Lamb, Oklahoma. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: This was a surprise, though the Cowboys probably were thrilled Lamb was available. Can play the slot or outside. Dallas did need a receiver with Randall Cobb leaving in free agency. Thought they might go with an Edge rusher. Can't go wrong with Lamb. Very good value pick, but they do need defensive help so they went with splashy pick to go along with Amari Cooper. Offense wins games, but defense wins championships. At least new coach Mike McCarthy will be happy with that pick.</p><p><strong>18)Miami Dolphins, OT Austin Jackson, USC. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: They got this pick last season for trading S Mikah Fitzpatrick to the Steelers. Ok, yes Miami desperately needed a tackle with the top four guys going off the board. But this is a bit of a reach. They could have gotten him with their later first-round pick. A lot of people did not have him ranked in the first round with guys like Ezra Cleveland, Josh Jones and Isaiah Wilson expected to go over him. Certainly has the athleticism. Just 20 so he might not play right away. Long arms. Good punch. But very raw against elite pass rushers. Will need time to develop Tua and so you might think both might redshirt this season. Not sure you take a guy that's basically a project in the first round.</p><p><strong>19)Vegas Raiders, CB Damon Arnette, Ohio State. Grade: D+</strong></p><p>Comments: Huh? Ohio State has Okudah and Arnette going in the first round. Arnette was a second-round pick on most boards. About 6 feet tall and 195. Can play the slot, but why would you take him that high? Is tough and physical. Can play press coverage. Wouldn't have taken him over Trevon Diggs. So Raiders reach a little for Ruggs and a lot here. Some things never change.</p><p><strong>20)Jacksonville Jaguars, OLB K'Lavon Chaisson, LSU. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good pick for Jags. Now they can trade Yannick Ngakoue. Raw player who needs to add strength. More about potential because production wasn't great last year. Sets the edge pretty well despite being just 6-3, 254.</p><p><strong>21)Philadelphia Eagles, Jalen Reagor, WR, TCU. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Interesting that they would bypass Justin Jefferson from LSU to take Reagor. He's 5-11, 206 and has good genes as his father played defensive line in the NFL. Has a great vertical leap and is a good return guy. Great athlete, but Jefferson is a better overall receiver. Played for a poor quarterback at TCU. Needs to improve as a route runner. Eagles desperately needed a receiver.</p><p><strong>22)Minnesota Vikings, WR Justin Jefferson, LSU, Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good pick for the Vikes, who traded away Stefon Diggs to Buffalo. Underrated receiver if that's possible. Decent size at 6-1, 202. Jefferson is a slot receiver who has the speed to play outside. Some concern about his ability to separate from the outside. Runs good routes. Will be interesting what they do with Adam Thielen, whether he continues to play in the slot. Ran a 4.46 at combine.</p><p><strong>23)LA Chargers (trade from New England), LB Kenneth Murray, Oklahoma. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Trade second and third-round picks to get the 23rd. Really good trade for the Patriots, who needed picks. Chargers could have taken Jordan Love here, but they already took Herbert with the No. 6 pick. Don't love the trade, but like the pick of Murray. They couldn't have picked him with their early second-round pick, because Ravens would have selected him at 28. He's 6-2.5, 240 and second-best linebacker after Simmons. Can get to the passer and has good closing speed. Has good burst and is a leader.</p><p><strong>24)New Orleans Saints, OL Cesar Ruiz, Michigan. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Interesting. Thought they might go with Jordan Love here to groom behind Drew Brees. Ruiz is the best center in the draft. Has long arms and is a good pass blocker. Can also play guard as he started five games there as a freshman. Not a glamorous pick, but you always add to the offensive line on the interior. They didn't necessarily need a center, so Ruiz could move to guard.</p><p><strong>25)San Francisco (from the Vikings). WR Brandon Aiyuk, Arizona State: Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: San Francisco got this pick from Minnesota for their 31st, 117th and 176th pick. That's a lot to move up six slots. The Niners desperately needed a receiver with Emmanuel Sanders. Has an 81-inch wingspan and 40-inch vertical to make up for his 6-foot height. A bit underrated and a strong returner. Can make big plays though not a burner. Still raw in route development. Not a bad pick for late in the first round. I guess they valued Kinlaw over taking a receiver like Jeudy at 14. Would have gone with Jeudy there and possibly Ross Blacklock from TCU here. But he's not Kinlaw and I guess they felt Aiyuk will be a very good No.2 receiver and nearly as good as Jeudy or Lamb.</p><p><strong>26)Green Bay Packers (trade with Miami), QB Jordan Love, Utah State. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: So this would have been Houston's pick. They trade Laremy Tunsil to Miami for a first-rounder, which became the 26th pick. Miami traded away their 26th pick to Green Bay for their 30th pick and the 136th pick in the draft. They take a stunning pick here with Jordan Love, another California native. Nothing against Love, but Rodgers isn't Dree Brees. He should have 2-3 years left. Love has great tools. For a team that needs wide receiver help and some more weapons for Rodgers. They rarely pick up free agents, so they better add some help late in the draft. They must really like Love and while Rodgers has declined some, he is still a top-10 guy. Head scratcher that you would trade up for him. Love struggled at Utah last season after a very good sophomore season. He could learn from Rodgers no doubt.</p><p><strong>27)Seattle Seahawks, ILB Jordyn Brooks, Texas Tech. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: At this point, not a bad pick. Though Patrick Queen made more sense. Struggles in coverage at times, but is a tackling machine. He's 6-0, 240, not tall but well built. Wasn't a first-rounder according to most experts.</p><p><strong>28)Baltimore Ravens, ILB Patrick Queen, LSU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens went for need. They lost both starting inside linebackers to free agency. Undersized at 6-0, 230. Can cover. Very athletic. Needs to add some bulk. Speed will help. Also helps to play behind Calais Campbell, Derek Wolfe and Brandon Williams. Should start right away.</p><p><strong>29)Tennessee Titans, OT Isaiah Wilson, Georgia. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Nice pick for that Titans this late. Wilson was a borderline first-rounder. Is huge at 6-6.5, 350 and is a dominant run blocker. Great size for a right tackle. Needs to improve his footwork and is still developing as a pass blocker. Titans love to run so he fits well.</p><p><strong>30)Miami Dolphins (trade from Green Bay). CB Noah Igbinoghene, Auburn. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Miami trades down to grab a corner that was supposed to go in the second round and they take him over Trevon Diggs. He's 5-11, 198 with great speed. Pretty raw in some areas. Should at least help as a nickel corner and a return man.</p><p><strong>31)Minnesota Vikings (trade with San Francisco). CB Jeff Gladney, TCU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Has first-round ability but concerns about knee issues. They certainly need help at corner with Xavier Rhodes gone and they really struggled on the back end last season. At 5-10, 191, most likely will defend the slot.</p><p><strong>32)Kansas City Chiefs, RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire, LSU. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Another shocker. Thought they might go with D'Andre Swift from Georgia. Good back with good quickness and can catch the ball. But he's more of a third-down back that lacks top-end speed. Maybe he fits with Patrick Mahomes better than Swift due to his catching ability. Can make people miss. Strong lower body. Needs to work on pass protection. Tough to be a three-down back for the Chiefs without it.</p><p><strong>Second Round</strong></p><p><strong>33)Cincinnati Bengals, WR Tee Higgins, Clemson. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Big receiver from Clemson. Passed on OLB Zack Baun, which was a need. But if you draft a franchise quarterback, you need to give him weapons. A.J. Green hasn't played in the last two years due to injuries. Could he be the next Green? Doesn't quite have the speed, but has the vertical leap and long arms make up for it in the red zone. Solid pick.</p><p><strong>34)Indianapolis Colts, WR Michael Pittman, USC. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: First pick of the draft, so they had to make this count. And they did. Pittman's father was a tough runner for Tampa Bay. His son is 6-4, 223 pounds. Decent speed at 4.52 with a lot of size and strength. A lot of tools. More than Higgins, but not quite as smooth. I would have taken him over Higgins.</p><p><strong>35)Detroit Lions, RB D'Andre Swift, Georgia. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Thought they would go defense again here with an edge rusher. Detroit hasn't been a relative team for running backs since Barry Sanders in the mid-nineties. Swift isn't Sanders, but he's a very good back. Arguably the best back in the draft, with receiving ability. Very explosive.</p><p><strong>36)New York Giants, S Xavier McKinney, Alabama. Grade: A+</strong></p><p>Comments: McKinney is the top safety in the draft and was taken in the second round. Guess not many teams wanted safeties. Struggled at the combine with his 40 time and that didn't help. Great pick by the Giants. Smart player who plays the run well.</p><p><strong>37)New England Patriots, S Kyle Dugger, Leonoir-Rhye. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments. A Division II safety who is big and can really play. Great size at 6-1, 217. Big adjustment from D2 to the NFL. Belichick must have loved him. Can also return punts. Ran a 4.49 40 so he does have the speed to hang with the pros.</p><p><strong>38)Carolina Panthers, DE Ytur Gross-Matos, Penn State. Grade B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Had 9.5 sacks at Penn State last season. First-round talent. Good size at 6-5, 266. Will now play with Derrick Brown, so for a team that desperately needed defensive help, it's a solid pick for new coach Matt Rhule.</p><p><strong>39)Miami Dolphins, OG Robert Hunt, Louisiana. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Big man show played both tackle positions as well as left guard. Probably the second-best guard after Cesar Ruiz. Arms are not very long but can overpower teams.</p><p><strong>40)Houston Texans, DT Ross Blacklock, TCU. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Bill O'Brien's first pick was a soli one. Blacklock is an agile player at 6-3, 290. Not really big for a defensive tackle. Could eventually develop into an interior pass rusher.</p><p><strong>41)Indianapolis Colts (from Cleveland), RB Johnathan Taylor, Wisconsin: Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Second pick for the Colts, who traded with Cleveland. They gave up picks 44 and 160. Big, strong and fast. Nobody doubts his production with 6,174 rushing yards. One problem? Ball security. Had 18 career fumbles and 15 lost. Never a good thing for a back. If he gets away from the fumbles, he could be a great back. Not a great receiver either and rarely lined up in pass protection.</p><p><strong>42)Jacksonville Jaguars, WR Laviska Shenault, Colorado. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Another wide receiver is taken. He's a powerhouse and is built more like a running back at 6-1, 227. Not a burner so a little concerned about taking him over Denzel Mims. But is basically a running back once he touches the ball and loves contact. A bit like Anquan Boldin.</p><p><strong>43)Chicago Bears, TE Cole Kmet, Notre Dame. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Solid tight end, who ran a 4.7 40. So he's not likely to become an elite TE. Good size, who has the frame to become a better blocker. Good athlete. Best of a mediocre tight end group. The Bears now have 10 tight ends on their roster.</p><p><strong>44)Cleveland Browns (from Indy), S Grant Delpit, LSU. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Browns gave up the 41st pick to get this pick and the 160th. Very good pick here by the Browns. Delpit won the Jim Thorpe Award last season for the best DB in the country. Has the size at 6-3, 213 and the speed at 4.5 in the 40. However, he does have tackling issues. Missed a ton last season possibly due to a high ankle sprain. Had a much better 2018 season when he was healthy. At least you know he has the size to cover tight ends.</p><p><strong>45)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, S Antoine Winfield, Minnesota. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments. Solid pick here and another safety. Father was a first-round pick in 1999 by Buffalo. He's not very big at 5-9, 203, but has tremendous ball skills. Very good against the run.</p><p><strong>46)Denver Broncos, WR K.J. Hamler, Penn State. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Interesting pick by John Elway. Another receiver after he picked up Jerry Jeudy in the first round. Just 5-9, 178 but a playmaker with insane speed. But had nine drops last year. He didn't run at the combine due to a hamstring issue. That probably helped him drop some. The drops and the lack of size didn't help either. Mims is surpassed again</p><p><strong>47)Atlanta Falcons, DT Marlon Davidson, Auburn. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: A slight reach here. He played defensive end at college at 6-4, 305. Needs to get his weight down, but looking at the three technique. Ran a 5.04 40, which isn't great. Hda good production and will set the edge at the size. Good thing is that he can play inside or out.</p><p><strong>48)Seattle Seahawks (from NY Jets), DE Darrell Taylor, Tennessee. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Seattles gives the Jets their 59th pick and 101st to get the 48th. Played linebacker in college. Struggled with injuries last season. Does help as an Edge rusher assuming they lose Jadeveon Clowney. Ran a 4.65 40. I had him going to Seattle with their pick at 64.</p><p><strong>49)Pittsburgh Steelers, WR Chase Claypool, Notre Dame. Grade B+.</strong></p><p>Comments: Candian wide receiver from Notre Dame at 6-4, 238 pounds, who ran a 4.42 40. The bigger issue is whether he can separate. At least he'll be a big target in the red zone.</p><p><strong>50)Chicago Bears, CB Jaylon Johnson, Utah. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Played last season with a torn labrum. That's impressive. Not bad size at 6-0, 193 and showed toughness. Good player that will help if he can stay healthy. If not for that, he might have gone in the first round. Good gamble.</p><p><strong>51)Dallas Cowboys, CB Trevon Diggs, Alabama. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Good pick here. Younger brother of Stefon Diggs. Good size at nearly 6-2, 205. Could play safety and that's where he started his career. Strong in press coverage. Needs to get more consistent. Has all the tools to be very good. Has first-round talent.</p><p><strong>52)LA Rams, RB Cam Akers, Florida State. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Have to grade this one an A since<a href="nfl-second-round-projections__ca+192.html">I called that pick</a>hours earlier. Will need to improve as a receiver. Has the size and speed to be very good. Played for a subpar Florida State team and didn't get much help. Should fit in well with Rams who got rid of Todd Gurley.</p><p><strong>53)Philadelphia Eagles, QB Jalen Hurts, Oklahoma. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Huh? Don't they have a guy named Carson Wentz? So you draft a quarterback in the second round to be a Taysom Hill-type? Nothing against Hurst nor Jordan Love. Just don't like the situation. Still raw as a passer, but made great strides last year at Oklahoma. Drafting a quarterback in the second round to use him in run packages? Is this the new NFL or just the fact that they are afraid of Wentz's injury history? Incredible runner but at some point, he'll want to be a starter and then the Eagles can trade him or Wentz.</p><p><strong>54)Buffalo Bills, DE A.J. Epenesa, Iowa. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Really good pick here. A first-round talent. Not a very explosive pass rusher. Has good size at 6-5, 275. Very productive despite lack of great explosion.</p><p><strong>55)Baltimore Ravens, RB J.K. Dobbins, Ohio State. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: This pick came from the Hayden Hurst trade. Thought they might go guard or receiver here. Not a major need. Very productive back in college. Mark Ingram is now over 30. Dobbins is more explosive than their top two backs in Ingram and Gus Edwards. Needs to improve his receiving skills.</p><p><strong>56)Miami Dolphins, DT Raekwon Davis, Alabama. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Never a bad thing to take an Alabama defensive player and one who was a three-year starter. Talented lineman. Not a great pass rusher. Strong hands and good run stopper. Good size at 6-6, 311.</p><p><strong>57)LA Rams, WR Van Jefferson, Florida. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Started career at Ole Miss and transferred to Florida. Son of Shawn Jefferson, a former NFL receiver and Jets WR coach. Decent size and good route runner. He's the 12th receiver taken in the first two rounds.</p><p><strong>58)Minnesota Vikings, OT Ezra Cleveland, Boise State. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Good player at 6-6, 311 and ran 4.93. May end up playing guard because he has short arms for a tackle. Has good feet and toughness. Vikes had a need here.</p><p><strong>59)New York Jets, WR Denzel Mims, Baylor. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Mims is 6-3, 210 and ran a 4.38 40. Baylor receivers don't run all the routes in the route tree, so there is an adjustment. But the size and speed are worth taking a shot on. It might take him a year, but for a late second-round pick, this was nice.</p><p><strong>60)New England (with Baltimore), OLB Josh Uche, Michigan. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: So Patriots also get Ravens' 129th overall pick and give up the 71st and 98th pick. Basically a second and a fourth for two thirds. He's 6-1, 240. Not very tall for an outside linebacker. Smart player, which is what Belichick likes. Undersized edge rusher who needs to improve against the run.</p><p><strong>61)Tennessee Titans, CB Kristian Fulton, LSU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good selection here, though Fulton had some drug testing issues at LSU. Very talented player with decent size at 6-0, 197. Not great length, but good speed. Could end up in the slot, but they are getting good value here.</p><p><strong>62)Green Bay Packers, RB A.J. Dillon, Boston College. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: No knock against Dillon. Packers need a receiver. Dillon will help the running game. Great size at 250 pounds and ran a 4.52 40. Not a great receiver. Packers seem to be going old school, back to the Jim Taylor days and Aaron Rodgers is becoming Bart Starr.</p><p><strong>63)Kansas City Chiefs, LB Willie Gay, Mississippi State. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Had off-the-field issues in terms of academic and fighting in practice. This is a game. He is 6-1 and 243 with some ability. Does have the talent to be a second-round pick and has great speed at 4.46 in the 40. If he can stay out of trouble, this is a steal.</p><p><strong>64)Carolina Panthers (from Seattle), S Jeremy Chinn, Southern Illinois. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Nice pick here for an FS player that ran a 4.45 40. That's even more impressive for a guy who is 6-3, 220. Tackling machine and great range. Good ball skills. This would have made sense for Seattle. A perfect fit for former Legion of Boom.</p><p><strong>Third Round</strong></p><p><strong>65)Cincinnati Bengals, ILB Logan Wilson, Wyoming. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-2, 240. Hard hitter. Has good ball skills and was a defensive back in high school. Very solid pick up.</p><p><strong>66)Washington Redskins, WR/RB Antonio Gibson, Memphis: Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Is he a running back or a wide receiver? Maybe that's why he fell to the third round. Explosive player with great size at 6-0, 228. But as a receiver, he's not very polished when it comes to running routes. Will be interesting to see how they use him.</p><p><strong>67)Detroit Lions, OLB Julian Okwara. Notre Dame. Grade: B</strong>-</p><p>Comments: Very athletic at 6-4, 252. Has the speed to get to quarterbacks as an EDGE. Needs to get stronger in the lower body to be able to set the edge. Not a three-down player yet.</p><p><strong>68)New York Jets, S Ashtyn Davis, California. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-1, 208. Very good range and instincts.</p><p><strong>69)Seattle (from Carolina), OL Damien Lewis, LSU Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good upper body strength. A short interior lineman at 6-2, 326. Not good length but very strong.</p><p><strong>70)Miami Dolphins, S Brandon Jones, Texas. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Not very big at 5-11, 198. Very good tackler and outstanding punt returner. Good hitter, but not a ball hawk.</p><p><strong>71)Baltimore (from New England), DT Justin Madubuikie, Texas A&M. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens traded down to get Madubuike. Adds some pass rush from the interior at 6-3, 290. Has the quickness to get int he backfield. Very strong. Can play next to Calais Campbell and Brandon Williams, who can take two linemen. They desperately needed some pass rush help.</p><p><strong>72)Arizona Cardinals, OT Josh Jones, Houston. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Very good value pick. Jones doesn't have the length that scouts are looking for, but he can be a starting tackle. Good pass blocker and that will help Kyler Murray.</p><p><strong>73)Jacksonville Jaguars, DT Davon Hamilton, Ohio State. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: So Ohio State is going to have their entire starting unit get drafted? He plays the nose at 6-4, 325. Six sacks is pretty good for a nose guard. Pretty good pick here.</p><p><strong>74)New Orleans Saints (from Cleveland), LB Zack Baun, Wisconsin. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Can't believe Baun went this late, even with a drug test issue. Tested positive for a diluted sample. Very productive player and good closing speed. Not very big at 6-3, 238. Rangy defender that can use some more size. Good instincts in coverage. Saints traded up to get him. Some medical concerns as well.</p><p><strong>75)Detroit (from Indy), G Jonah Jackson, Ohio State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another Buckeye. A former Rutgers Scarlet Knight. Good draft for Detroit thus far, getting two offensive players and two defensive guys. Good upper body strength. Needs to improve pass blocking and strong run blocker.</p><p><strong>76)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, RB Ke'Shawn Vaughn, Vanderbilt. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Nothing fancy at 5-10, 214 with 4.52 speed. Basically a north-south runner. Not a bad receiver. Doesn't really move the pile. Not a bad number two back behind Ronald Jones. Will need to catch passes from TB12.</p><p><strong>77)Denver Broncos, CB Michael Ojemudia, Iowa. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Wait, they didn't draft a third receiver? Good size at 6-1, 200. Smart player, but maybe a reach in the third round. Probably a fourth or fifth-rounder.</p><p><strong>78)Atlanta Falcons, C Matt Hennessy, Temple. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: The first true center at 6-4, 307. Decent size for that position with good quickness. Short arms. Good zone blocker with solid quickness.</p><p><strong>79)New York Jets, DE Jabari Zuniga, Florida. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Good motor and decent size at 6-3, 264. Good rund defender and solid burst. Not a great athlete.</p><p><strong>80)Vegas Raiders, RB/WR Lynn Bowden, Kentucky. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Jack of all trades player. Kind of like a younger Randall Cobb, who will play in the slot. Sturdy at 5-11, 204 and a former quarterback, last season. Not super fast, but quick and perfect for the slot, but they can line him up all over the field.</p><p><strong>81)Vegas Raiders, WR Bryan Edwards, South Carolina. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another receiver for the Raiders. They also have Ruggs and Bowden. Edwards has good size at 6-3, 212 with good speed. He does have the speed that the Raiders love, but inconsistent hands.</p><p><strong>82)Dallas Cowboys, DT Neville Gallimore, Oklahoma. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another Canadian. A bit of a reach here. Not consistent. Is 6-3, 304 but not very athletic. Is strong and can get off blocks.</p><p><strong>83)Denver Broncos, C Lloyd Cushenberry III, LSU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Should have been drafted in the second round. Good player at 6-3, 312 and smart. Needs some strength. Good knee-bender. Has big hands and good mobility.</p><p><strong>84)LA Rams, LB Terrell Lewis, Alabama. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: First-round talent who has battled injuries. Good size at 6-5, 262 and athleticism. If the Rams just use him as a pass rusher, he'll thrive. Missed most of the 2017 and all of the 2018 seasons with injuries. Use him as a situational guy and he could get double-digit sacks.</p><p><strong>85)Indianapolis Colts (from Philly through Detroit), S Julian Blackmon, Utah. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: A second-team All-American who tore his ACL in the Pac-12 title game. Good player if healthy. Maybe he redshirts this season. Average size at 6-0, 187.</p><p><strong>86)Buffalo Bills, RB Zack Moss, Utah. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Another Utah player. Cousin of Santana and Sinorice Moss. So he has good genes. Very productive back. At 5-9, 223, is a physical runner. Good pass blocker. More of a zone scheme runner. Not a burner, but has pretty good playing speed. Broke 53 tackles this past season.</p><p><strong>87)New England Patriots, OLB Anfernee Jennings, 6-2, 256, Alabama. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Bill finally went with an Alabama player. Jennings had eight sacks last season. He's 6-2, 256, so not huge for a defensive end/OLB. Has good quickness and power. Smart player with a good motor and that's a New England trait. They've gone all defense with their three picks.</p><p><strong>88)Cleveland Browns, DT Jordan Elliott, Missouri. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-4, 302. Will shore up the interior of the defensive line. Good quickness and power.</p><p><strong>89)Minnesota Vikings, CB Cameron Dantzler, Mississippi State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: A tall, lanky corner at 6-2, 188. They take another corner after drafting Jeff Gladney in the first round. A tough press corner who ran a very slow 40 time at the combine.</p><p><strong>90)Houston Texans, LB Jonathan Greenard, Florida. Grade: C-.</strong></p><p>Comments: A linebacker without great athletic gifts to rush the edge. Good size at 6-3, 263 but the lack of closing speed will limit him.</p><p><strong>91)New England (Trade Raiders), TE Devin Asiasi, UCLA. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-3, 257. Pretty good hands. Not a bad blocker, but needs to get stronger. Pretty athletic for his size. Pats are desperate for tight end help as they were awful at that position last season, but he's not even Gronk-lite.</p><p><strong>92)Baltimore Ravens, WR Devin Duvernay, Texas. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Just 5-10, 200 pounds. Ravens need a receiver, but they could use some size. Duvernay does not supply that, but he is another burner. Most likely will play in the slot, but not this year with Willie Snead still around. Needs to work on his routes. A slot receiver who runs a 4.39 to eventually team with the even faster Hollywood Brown is not a bad thing. He also has good hands.</p><p><strong>93)Tennessee Titans, RB Darrynton Evans, Appalachian State. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Not the biggest back at 5-10, 203, but the Titans don't need one with Derrick Henry. Evans can catch the ball and replace Dion Lewis in the passing game. He can also give Henry a rest, which he does need occasionally.</p><p><strong>94)Green Bay Packers, TE Josiah Deguara, Cincinnati. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Just 6-3, 242. Not good size. Very productive at Cincinnati. Rodgers must still be scratching his head. Good thing is that Deguara can run and has good hands. Bad thing is lack of size and doesn't do a lot after the catch.</p><p><strong>95)Denver Broncos, DT McTelvin Agim, Arkansas. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Solid pick here as Agim is 6-3, 309 and could push to start. Has some skills as a pass rusher and has good length. He provides depth the ability to start next to Jurell Casey in a year or two.</p><p><strong>96)Kansas City Chiefs, OT Lucas Niang, TCU, Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick. Niang provides depth and could start in a few years. Good athlete and has some length. Could develop into an elite pass blocker.</p><p><strong>97)Cleveland Browns, ILB Jacob Phillips, LSU. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: The 10th pick for LSU. Very quick to ball. Can't go wrong with getting another LSU linebacker. They were terrible against the run last season. Also a good special teams player.</p><p><strong>98)Baltimore Ravens, ILB Malik Harrison, Ohio State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another inside linebacker at 6-3, 247 or is he? The Ravens struggled against the run, allowing 4.4 yards per carry. Their linebacking play was weak up the middle and on the edge. Harrison can rush the passer and is fast for his size with a 4.66 40. Steal here in the third round. A two-down linebacker that can get off the field on third downs.</p><p><strong>99)NY Giants, OT Matt Peart, UConn. Grade: B-.</strong></p><p>Comments: Not a bad pickup for a very tall (6-7, 318) tackle from a bad program. Can play either tackle spot. Could eventually replace Nate Solder down the line.</p><p><strong>100)Vegas Raiders, S/LB Tanner Muse, Clemson. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-2, 227. Hybrid safety and linebacker. A lot of hybrid guys going fairly early. Muse is really athletic, but what is he? A linebacker? A big safety? Good against the run.</p><p><strong>101)New England (from the Jets), TE Dalton Keene, Virginia Tech. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Has decent size at 6-4, 254. Pats are going tight end crazy. They took Keene over Troutman, which made little sense. Most likely a number two tight end at best.</p><p><strong>102)Pittsburgh Steelers, OLB Alex Highsmith, Charlotte. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Had 14 sacks last year. Former walk-on. Good size at 6-3, 248. Ran a 4.7 40. Just their second pick. Good closing speed and is a disruptive run defender. Steelers usually do well with drafting 3/4 outside linebackers.</p><p><strong>103)Philadelphia Eagles, OLB Davion Taylor, Colorado. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Almost no high school football experience. Ran 4.49 40. Great athlete. Can play a lot of positions. Not very big at 6-1, 228. But he's another hybrid safety/linebacker type. Good speed but coverage is not as good as you'd think.</p><p><strong>104)LA Rams, S Terrell Burgess, Utah. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-0, 205. Can play safety or nickel. Versatile player. Solid tackler and can play close to the line of scrimmage. Not a ballhawk.</p><p><strong>105)New Orleans Saints (from Vikings), TE Adam Trautman, Dayton. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-5, 255. Ran a 4.8 40. Maybe that's why he went this low. Very productive player. Good value pick. Has good quickness and plays faster than his 40 time showed. Needs to improve blocking, but you can say that about most receiving tight ends. Had 70 catches last season. That's impressive for a tight end at any level.</p><p><strong>106)Baltimore Ravens: OT Tyre Phillips, Mississippi State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Is 6-5, 330. Played left tackle, but could move to guard. Ravens are desperate for help there. Can he play right guard to replace Marshall Yanda or left guard and they can move Bradley Bozeman to right guard. Also could battle Ben Powers for right guard spot. If he can make that transition, this is a quality pick in the third round.</p><p><h4></h4></p><p><h4>Fourth Round</h4></p><p><strong>107)Cincinnati Bengals, OLB Akeem Davis-Gaither, Appalachian State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: At 6-2, 224, he's on the thin side. Has short arms, but can cover and could also help as a pass rusher. Plays with good pad level. Pretty good value pick here.</p><p><strong>108) Washington Redskins, OT Saahdiq Charles, LSU. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Yes, Charles has talent, possibly late second round to early third round. He would have been a risk in those rounds, but at the top of the fourth, this isn't bad. Charles can play both tackles spots, but has short arms. Also has red flags, which is why he was picked here.</p><p><strong>109)Vegas Raiders (from Detroit) OG John Simpson, Clemson. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Simpson is 6-4, 321 with long arms and pretty good speed. Also has potential to play right tackle or center, but just played guard in college. Solid pick in the fourth round.</p><p><strong>110)New York Giants, CB Darnay Holmes, UCLA. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Short corner at 5-10, 195 with short arms. Good speed, though doesn't play that fast Can play zone. Gets beat over the top. Most likely a nickel corner. Ran 4.48 40.</p><p><strong>111)Miami Dolphins, G Solomon Kindley, Georgia. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Ok pick here. Kindley is massive at 6-3, 337 and played in the SEC. Short arms and should do fine as a run blocker But his pass blocking is questionable. Can play either guard position.</p><p><strong>112)LA Chargers, RB Joshua Kelley, UCLA. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not a bad pick here as Kelley is 5-11, 212 with good shiftiness. Not a bad pass blocker and could eventually develop into a quality receiver out the backfield. A transfer from UC Davis.</p><p><strong>113)Carolina Panthers, CB Troy Pride Jr., Notre Dame. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Pride has shorter arms and average size at 6-0, 193. Has the speed to run with anybody. Has issues struggling to track the ball vertically. Ran a 4.4 40 at the combine.</p><p><strong>114)Arizona Cardinals, DT Leki Fotu, Utah. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Utah is having a heck of a draft. The Cards get a massive run stuffer at 6-5, 330. Still a bit raw and doesn't rush the passer well. But a run-clogger here in the fourth round is not a bad pick. Ran a 5.1 40, so he can move.</p><p><strong>115)Cleveland Browns, TE Harrison Bryant, Florida Atlantic. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Bryant was a top-five tight end and not a bad thing to get him this late. He has good speed, but not good size at 6-5, 243. Can get away from defenders, though had some issues with drops. Needs to put on at least 10 pounds.</p><p><strong>116)Jacksonville Jaguars, OT Ben Bartch, St. John's (MN). Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Nice pick with a Division III player, who is an athlete. Started out at tight end an moved to left tackle. Since he lacks the arm length for a tackle, should move to guard. Yes, he played D3, but also showed he's legit at the Senior Bowl.</p><p><strong>117)Minnesota Vikings,</strong> DE D.J. Wonnum, South Carolina. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: Wonnum is 6-5, 258 and a pretty lean EDGE rusher that needs some more size. Pretty good rusher, but not good against the run. Will get overpowered. Ran a 4.73 30.</p><p><strong>118)Denver Broncos, TE Albert Okwuegbunam, Missouri. Grade B-</strong></p><p>Comments: has all the speed, length and size to be elite. But he wasn't in college. Averaged just 11.8 yards per catch. Not a great route runner. But he played with Drew Lock at Missouri, so that should count for something. Ran a 4.49 40 at the combine, which is incredible for his size at 6-5, 258.</p><p><strong>119)Atlanta Falcons, LB Mykal Walker, Fresno State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good speed and length at 6-3, 230. Can rush the passer and good in coverage. He can play outside linebacker or inside. Should also be a very good special teams player.</p><p><strong>120)New York Jets, RB La'Michal Perine, Florida. Grade: B</strong>+</p><p>Comments: Not a bad pick here as Perine is a pretty good back out of the backfield. Is 5-11, 215, but just average production as a runner. Did catch 40 passes last season with five TDs.</p><p><strong>121)Detroit Lions, OG Logan Stenberg, Kentucky. Grade: B+.</strong></p><p>Comments: Lions are having a good draft. Stenberg is a mauler at 6-6, 317 and can generate push in the running game. Not a great athlete and that's why's more guard than tackle. Could develop into a starter eventually.</p><p><strong>122)Indianapolis Colts, QB Jacob Eason, Washington. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: This was a good spot to take a quarterback for the Colts, who need to develop one behind Philip Rivers. Though they may just put Eason on the IR or make him inactive if they keep Jacoby Brissette. Eason is 6-6, 231 with great size and arm strength. He needs to become more consistent to develop into a starter at the next level and to improve his decision-making. Work ethic is a concern, but can learn a lot from Rivers.</p><p><strong>123)Dallas Cowboys, CB Reggie Robinson, Tulsa. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-1, 205 and had four interceptions last season. Small hands, but you have to like the size and speed. Good potential, but will need some time.</p><p><strong>124)Pittsburgh Steelers, RB Anthony McFarland, Maryland. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Steelers were desperate for a back and got a smallish one in McFarland, who averaged a ridiculous 6.7 yards per carry behind a shaky offensive line at Maryland. McFarland is just 5-8, 208 with a very good burst but is not an every-down back. Battled ankle injuries last season.</p><p><strong>125)New York Jets, QB James Morgan, FIU. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Not sure why the Jets would take a quarterback in the fourth round, with Sam Darnold as their franchise guy. Morgan is 6-4, 230 with a strong arm and good release. Has toughness, but he's streaky and his touch is iffy. Not a threat to run. His projection is as a backup, but you could have gotten him later. Did have a good Senior Bowl. This is not based on Morgan, but more about need.</p><p><strong>126)Houston Texans, OT Charlie Heck, North Carolina. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Very tall tackle at 6-8, but just 311. Has good length to block speed rushers. Needs to get bigger and work on technique.</p><p><strong>127)Philadelphia Eagles, S K'Von Wallace, Clemson. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: A bit of a reach here. Wallace is just 5-11, 205 and more of a nickel corner or safety lining up against the slot. Not great range nor is he long enough. He is tough and a pretty good tackler.</p><p><strong>128)Bufallo Bills, WR Gabriel Davis, UCF. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Has good size at 6-2, 216, but not very fast. Has good hands, but not a complete route runner. Doesn't have the speed to separate.</p><p><strong>129)New York Jets, OT Cameron Clark, Charlotte. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Clark is 6-5, 308, so has enough size to play offensive tackle. Has the length to block speed rushers and does haven edge to his game. Not a bad pick here to take a chance on a mid-major FBS tackle.</p><p><strong>130)Minnesota Vikings, DT James Lynch, Baylor. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Has the size to play defensive end or tackle. Good pass rusher, but has short arms. Average speed for an end.Had 13.5 sacks last year so very productive. Better suited for 3-technique in NFL. Played 5-technique at Baylor.</p><p><strong>131)Arizona Cardinals, DT Rashard Lawrence, LSU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good value pick for the Cards. They get a three-time captain who has very athletic. Not long, but has a great motor. Probably not a full-time starter, but a rotation guy who can pla 3-technique or some at the nose.</p><p><strong>132)Minnesota Vikings, LB Troy Dye, Oregon. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Is 6-3, 231 with good range. Played well despite having a cast on his hands the final eight games of the season. needs to add some size to defend tight ends but is really good in coverage. Nice pick.</p><p><strong>133)Seattle Seahawks, TE Colby Parkinson, Stanford. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick. A big target at 6-7, 252 who can grab 50-50 balls. Caught 48 passes last season. Doesn't have great speed, but could fit in well as a number two tight end, who can block. Just one drop on the year. Seventh tight end to be drafted from Stanford since 2012. That's remarkable.</p><p><strong>134)Atlanta Falcons, S Jaylinn Hawkins, California. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Started three years at Cal. A good run stopper at 6-1, 208 has adequate range to play FS. Does have good hands and good length. Good hands as a former receiver. Needs to become more consistent in tackling.</p><p><strong>135)Pittsburgh Steelers, OG Kevin Dodson, Louisiana. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Did not go to the combine. Wasn't invited. That doesn't mean he can't play. Is 6-4, 313 with decent athletic ability. Not good length. Has some work to do in terms of technique, but strong with a nasty disposition. Started in 52 games.</p><p><strong>136)LA Rams, TE Brycen Hopkins, Purdue. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not very big at 6-4, 245. Good runner after the catch and pretty good at running routes. He's really just a big receiver with good athleticism, but is not going to be an effective blocker.</p><p><strong>137)Jacksonville Jaguars, CB Josiah Scott, Michigan State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments:Small corner at 5-9, 185. Also has short arms and small hands. Does cover a lot of ground and is athletic. Probably ends up as a slot corner. Did have seven picks in three years.</p><p><strong>138)Kansas City Chiefs, S L'Jarius Sneed, Louisiana Tech. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Very fast safety who runs well. Very well at 4.37 40. Needs to improve his technique. Good tackler. Can also play corner at 6-1, 192. That might where he ends up. Also jumped 41 inches so the potential is there.</p><p><strong>139)Vegas Raiders, CB Amirk Robertson, Louisiana Tech. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments:Undersized corner at 5-8, 187. Tough to play outside corner at that size against 6-4 wide receivers. But he is physical in press coverage and had 14 interceptions. Most likely will play slot corner.</p><p><strong>140)Jacksonville Jaguars, ILB Shaquille Quarterman, Miami-Fla. Grade:B</strong></p><p>Comments: a four-year starter who was very productive with 356 tackles and 13 sacks. Not very big at 6-1, 234. But can project to a two-down linebacker with some athletic limitations.</p><p><strong>141)Houston Texans, CB John Reid, Penn State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Good quickness and speed. Just 5-10, 187 and not very physical. Could struggle against bigger receivers with below-average length. Also an inconsistent tackler.</p><p><strong>142)Washington Redskins, WR Antonio Gandy-Golden, Liberty. Grade:B+</strong></p><p>Comments: This is the spot where you take a chance on a 6-4, 223-pound receiver from Liberty. Is not a burner, but plays faster. Has good size and overpowered smaller defenders at Liberty. Will that translate in the NFL?</p><p><strong>143)Baltimore Ravens, OG Ben Bredeson, Michigan. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens are addressing all their needs thus far. Bredson is a strong run blocker, who doesn't have great length at 6-5, 315. Will need to improve pass blocking and his lack of foot speed could make it tough against elite 3-techniques. Still like this pick because it gives them options at guard with Marshall Yanda gone.</p><p><strong>144)Seattle Seahawks, RB DeeJay Dallas, Miami-Fla. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick. Dallas will have to work on pass blocking. Offers a strong punt returner who averaged 17.4 yards at Miami. A former receiver, so he can catch the ball out of the backfield. Also has the ability to make people miss.</p><p><strong>145)Philadelphia Eagles, OG Jack Driscoll, Auburn. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens could have chosen Driscoll at 143. He's 6-5, 306, so a little light. Lined up at right tackle in college. A two-year starter at Auburn, who played guard at UMass. Not overpowering run blocker, but better pass blocker than Bredeson. Could backup at guard and tackle. Good technique.</p><p><strong>146)Dallas Cowboys (from Eagles), C Tyler Biadasz, Wisconsin. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Very good pick. Biadasz is 6-4, 314 and a solid run blocker. Has good power. That's pretty good size for a center. Not a great athlete who struggles to get to the second level.</p><p><h4></h4></p><p><h4>Fifth Round</h4></p><p><strong>147)Cincinnati Bengals, Edge Khalid Kareem, Notre Dame. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Has good size and length at 6-4, 268. Probably a situational player. But has good motor and quickness. Would like to see more production at Notre Dame.</p><p><strong>148)Seattle Seahawks (from Washington through Carolina), DE Alton Robinson, Syracuse. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Just not a great draft for defensive ends. Robinson has all the tools and ran a fast 40 time. Decent size at 6-3, 264. Needs to get stronger against the run and doesn't do a good enough job getting off blocks.</p><p><strong>149)Indianapolis Colts, G Danny Pinter, Ball State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Pinterplayed tight end the first three seasons at Ball State and then started at right tackle. He does have good athletic ability and can pass block on the inside. Projected as a guard.</p><p><strong>150)New York Giants, G Shane Lemieux, Oregon. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: A solid four-year starter at 6-4, 310. Never missed a game. Solid run blocker. Good quickness and lower body strength. Quality pick here.</p><p><strong>151)LA Chargers, WR Joe Reed, Virginia. Grade:B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Reed is built like a running back at 6-1, 224. Can line up in the slot and at running back. Very dangerous return man. Another versatile guy who can cover kicks and has 17 tackles.</p><p><strong>152)Carolina Panthers, S Kenny Robinson, West Virginia. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like thinking out of the box. Played in the XFL. Had some academic issues at West Virginia. good player who is a ballhawk. A steal here if he can mature.</p><p><strong>153)San Francisco (from Miami), OT Colton McKivitz, West Virginia. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comment: This was the pick for<a href="https://dolphinswire.usatoday.com/2020/04/25/dolphins-trade-pick-no-153-for-49ers-rb-matt-breida/">RB Matt Breida</a>. Nice pick up for the 49ers. At 6-6, 306, could use a little more size. Is strong in the running game, but needs work as a pass protector. May end up at guard.</p><p><strong>154)Miami Dolphins (from Jax through Pittsburgh), DE Jason Strowbridge, North Carolina. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-4, 275, where does he play? Has short arms for defensive tackle. Not fast enough for an end. Good strength and did well at Senior Bowl. Solid run defender. May turn out as a run-stuffing defensive end and one or two-down player</p><p><strong>155)Chicago Bears, DE Trevis Gipson, Tulsa. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick here. Gipson can play end or outside linebacker at 6-3, 261. Has good length, size and speed. Needs to work on coming off his blocks. Has good inside moves at rushing the passer and disrupts as a run defender.</p><p><strong>156)Washington Redskins, C Keith Ismael, San Diego State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: A good pick for the Skins. Ismael is a sound pass blocker and has good toughness. Centers don't often go very high. Average size at 6-3, 309. Can also play some guard.</p><p><strong>157)Jacksonville Jaguars, S Daniel Thomas, Auburn. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Thomas is 5-10, 215, so built like a small linebacker More of a box safety who lacks great range. Good instincts in coverage. Tough against the run. Not a bad pick for Jags.</p><p><strong>158)NY Jets, CB Bryce Hall, Virginia. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Didn't love them taking a quarterback in the fourth round, but Hall is a steal here. At 6-1, 202, has good size Good length and has the playing speed to develop into a starting corner. Has big hands as well, which would help in grabbing picks.</p><p><strong>159)New England Patriots, PK Justin Rohrwasser, Marshall. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Never liked taken a field goal kicker this high, unless he's Justin Tucker, who was undrafted. Maybe Pats thought he they had so many picks, it was worth a gamble. Pats needed a kicker with Stephen Gostkowski gone. Made 15 of his 20 field goal attempts and 39 of 41 extra points at Rhode Island. At Marshall, made 33 of his 42 field goal attempts and 79 of 72 extra points. Has a career long of 52.</p><p><strong>160)Cleveland Browns, C Nick Harris, Washington. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Solid pick with a first-team All-Pac 12 selection in his last two seasons. Harris is just 6-1, 302 but is very agile and tough. Undersized player who will play with a chip on his shoulder. Had 42 starts in four seasons.</p><p><strong>161)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, WR Tyler Johnson, Minnesota. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-1, 206. Good route runner. Very good after the catch. Just doesn't have great speed. Had some drops and has small hands. Very productive receiver. Solid pick here if he can get open and catch the ball for TB12.</p><p><strong>162)Washington Redskins, OLB Khaleke Hudson, Michigan. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Undersized linebacker with short arms, but is very fast. Just 5-11, 224 and can stop the run. Most likely a special teams player with his speed.</p><p><strong>163)Chicago Bears, CB Kindle Vildor, Georgia Southern. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Just 5-10, but a solid 191 pounds. His good length makes up for lack of size. Also good ball skills and hands. Most likely a nickel back because he's not a burner on the field.</p><p><strong>164)Miami Dolphins, DE Curtis Weaver, Boise State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good pick here. Weaver was expected to go higher. He just gets things done, despite not having great speed or quickness. Needs to play with better pad level. Had 13.5 sacks last year and 34 in three years at Boise State.</p><p><strong>165)Jacksonville Jaguars, WR Collin Johnson, Texas. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Very tall receiver at 6-6, 222. So he's a huge target in the red zone. Not very fast, but can get vertical and can get yards after contact. Tough for very tall receivers to get open in the middle of the field, so he will need to work on his routes.</p><p><strong>166)Detroit Lions, WR Quintez Cephus, Wisconsin. Grade: C</strong>-</p><p>Comments: Productive receiver who is 6-1, 202. Very strong frame and good runner after the catch. Has small hands and not a consistent receiver. Will drop some. Will have to improve to make the team. Some legal issues as well in his past.</p><p><strong>167)Buffalo Bills, QB Jake Fromm, Georgia. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Fromm really fell down. Not great size at 6-2, 219 and lacks arm strength. Pretty good college quarterback who projects as a backup in the NFL. Bills don't need a starter, so adequate pick here. Smart player who manages the game well.</p><p><strong>168)Philadelphia Eagles (from NE), WR John Hightower, Boise State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: This was the Eagles' second receiver taken after Jalen Reagor. Hightower is 6-2, 189 and caught 51 passes for 943 yards with eight TDs. has the speed to get vertical. Needs to add some size.</p><p><strong>169)Minnesota Vikings, CB Harrison Hand, Temple. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Vikings are having a strong draft. Hand is not a start, but is a tough run defender at 5-11, 197. Physical player with decent speed and plays the ball well in zone.</p><p><strong>170)Baltimore Ravens, DT Broderick Washington, Texas Tech. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments. Ravens needed an Edge so this was disappointing. But they did need depth behind Brando Williams. He's just not as big as Williams or Michael Pierce (gone) at 6-2, 305. Won't command double teams.</p><p><strong>171)Houston Texans, WR Isaiah Coulter, Rhode Island. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Like taking FCS players here. Coulter is 6-2, 198 with good speed. He can use some weight and some work on his route running A developmental receiver that might contribute in a year or two.</p><p><strong>172)Detroit Lions, RB Jason Huntley, New Mexico State. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: The Lions got their runner in Swift, but they need some depth. Huntley is explosive at 5-8, 190. Rushed for over 1,000 yards last season and also caught 134 passes for 1,119 yards in his career.</p><p><strong>173)Chicago Bears, WR Darnell Mooney, Tulane. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: I've been waiting to say it's a meh pick. Mooney is 5-10, 176 so not only is he small, but he's light. Not great hands either. Will play the slot if he makes the team.</p><p><strong>174)Tennessee Titans, DT Larell Murchison, NC State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Good run defender at 6-3, 297. Had seven sacks, though 5.5 came against Florida State and Syracuse. He's light for a defensive tackle and not long enough for a 3-4 defensive end.</p><p><strong>175)Green Bay Packers, ILB Kamal Martin, Minnesota. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Martin has decent size at 6-3, 240 and is strong against the run. Also not bad in coverage, but would be better in zone than in man.</p><p><strong>176)Minnesota Vikings, WR K.J. Osborn, Miami-Fla. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Average size at 6-0, 203 and runs well after the catch. Also good blocker, but averaged just 10.9 yards per catch.</p><p><strong>177)Kansas City Chiefs, DE Mike Danna, Michigan. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not very big at 6-2, 251. Gives good effort at rushing the passer. Will need to get stronger to play the run. Really just a rotational guy at Michigan. Will have to make it on special teams.</p><p><strong>178)Denver Broncos, OLB Justin Strnad, Wake Forest. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not a misspelling. That's how you spell his last name. Has good height at 6-3, 238. Very rangy and gives good effort. But lacks elite speed. Good awareness.</p><p><strong>179)Dallas Cowboys, DE Badley Anae, Utah. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Another solid Utah player on defense. Anae is a team captain who gets the most out of his ability. Lacks size, has short arms and elite speed. But sometimes guys like Anae get by on effort and a motor.</p><p><h4></h4></p><p><h4>Sixth Round</h4></p><p><strong>180)Cincinnati Bengals, OT Hakeem Adeniji, Kansas. Grade B</strong>-</p><p>Comments: A solid tackle for a bad team at 6-4, 302. Started at left and right tackle. Very solid in the running game. Might be moved to guard or will just end up as a swing tackle off the bench.</p><p><strong>181)Denver Broncos, G Netane Muti, Fresno State. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Stout player at 6-3, 315 with short arms. Very strong guard, who benched 225, 44 times. He just dominates in the running game. Not bad in pass protection either. Very good pick this late.</p><p><strong>182)New England (from Colts), G Michael Onswenu, Michigan. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Solid guard who has the size at 6-3, 344 and the power. Not a great athlete or he would get picked higher Mostly a right guard, but can play some left guard.</p><p><strong>183)New York Giants, OLB Cam Brown, Penn State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Very tall linebacker who can play inside or outside. Needs to become more consistent. Has some upside.</p><p><strong>184)Carolina Panthers, DT Bravvion Roy, Baylor. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Big nose guard at 6-1, 330. Very powerful and agile. Has short arms and needs to be more consistent. A rotation guy to start off at best.</p><p><strong>185)Miami Dolphins, LB/LS Blake Ferguson, LSU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Tall but undersized long snapper at 6-3, 229, who played a little linebacker. That's where he's gong to make it.</p><p><strong>186)LA Chargers, S Alohi Gilman, Notre Dame. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Lacks size at 5-11, 201. Lack of speed and short arms. Not a lot of range and burst. Did force six fumbles.</p><p><strong>187)Cleveland Browns, WR Donovan Peoples-Jones, Michigan. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Big receiver at 6-2, 212. Has pretty good speed and talent. A groin injury slowed him down. To get a potential NFL starter this late is really good.</p><p><strong>188)Buffalo Bills, PK Tyler Bass, Georgia Southern. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Bills may have found a good one, though Bass is that great past 45 yards. He could push Stephen Hauschka, but again, if you don't have many needs, take a kicker late. If you do, wait for free agency.</p><p><strong>189)Jacksonville Jaguars, QB Jake Luton, Oregon State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Big quarterback at 6-6, 224 and threw just three picks last year. His delivery needs work and well, as a developmental qb, he needs to improve most things.</p><p><strong>190)San Francisco 49ers, TE Charlie Worner, Georgia. Grade: D+</strong></p><p>Comments: He's no George Kittle. Not at 6-5, 244, with room to add some size. Had just 34 career receptions and is more of an H-back type. Long shot.</p><p><strong>191)New York Jets, P Brandon Mann, Texas A&M. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Mann can really boom them and he might be the starter by default. Good athlete.</p><p><strong>192)Green Bay Packers, OT Jon Runyan, Michigan. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Very odd draft for the Packers. Father was a beast of a right tackle with the Eagles and Titans. Very smart though limited athletically. But this is a pretty good pick for the Packers because Runyan is a technician and has great genes.</p><p><strong>193)Indianapolis Colts, DT Robert Windson, Penn State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Big, lanky tackle at 6-5, 290. Very athletic with a motor with good length. Could be a rotation guy right away and will need to get bigger. Solid 3-technique.</p><p><strong>194)Tampa Bay Bucs, DT Khalil Davis, Nebraska. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Davis ran an insane 4.75 40 at 6-1, 308. That's faster than many tight ends in this draft. He is raw and is not a natural nose tackle. Good pick this late.</p><p><strong>195)New England Patriots, OT Justin Herron, Wake Forest. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Seems like the Patriots have had a 100 picks. Herron is a waist bender who played left tackle in the ACC. But doesn't have the length to play that position in the NFL. Not big enough to play guard.</p><p><strong>196)Philadelphia Eagles, ILB Shaun Bradley, Temple. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: A 6-1, 235-pound linebacker who ran a strong time at the combine. His tackling is inconsistent, but his speed will allow to cover running backs and tight ends. At least has the potential to be situational linebacker.</p><p><strong>197)Detroit Lions, DT John Penisini, Utah. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Penisini is 6-1, 318 with good size and strength. Plays the run well. Not much of a pass rusher, but has enough size to play nose tackle.</p><p><strong>198)Pittsburgh Steelers, S Antoine Brooks, Maryland. Grade :B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another Terp for Pittsburgh, Brooks is a smart defender, who has versatility. What does he play? He's 5-11, 220 and is one of those hybrid safety/linebackers. Physical player who can compete on special teams and backup safety.</p><p><strong>199)LA Rams, S Jordan Fuller, Ohio State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Solid pick this late, getting an Ohio State defender. Fuller has good range and instincts. Decent size at 6-2, 203. Good agaisnt the run.</p><p><strong>200)Philadelphia Eagles, WR Quez Watkins, Southern Miss. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Another receiver. Good for the Eagles. Watkins rank a 4.35 30, but wait for it. Has inconsistent hands. Ouch. Not what Eagles' fans want to hear, but very good value at this pick.</p><p><strong>201)Baltimore Ravens, WR James Pocher, SMU. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Very productive wide receiver and even at 24, not a bad pick. Very good hands. But why would the Ravens pick another slot receiver with Willie Snead and Duvernay from Texas? He does return kicks. That helps.</p><p><strong>202)Arizona Cardinals, ILB Evan Weaver, California. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Very good against the run. At 6-2, 237, has pretty good speed. Good effort. Will be solid on special teams.</p><p><strong>203)Minnesota Vikings, OT Balke Brandel, Oregon State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Vikes are loading up on big uglys and picks. Brandel is 6-7, 303, so he's very tall. Can play either tackle spot. Not a mauler in the running game.</p><p><strong>204)New England Patriots, LB Cassh Maluia, Wyoming. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Short but powerful inside linebacker at 6-0, 248. Good ball skills. Just 61 total tackles last year. Played with Logan Wilson and was overshadowed by him. Situational guy at best. Most likely special teams guy.</p><p><strong>205)Minnesota Vikings, S Josh Metellus, Michigan. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Hey, the Vikings are on the clock again. Metellus is 5-11, 209 with long arms and big hands. Has good speed. Solid run defender. Good pick and you wonder why he went so late. Maybe because he lacks great range.</p><p><strong>206)Jacksonville Jaguars, TE Tyler Davis, Georgia Tech. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Just 240 pounds at 6-4. Does have some speed. Caught just 17 passes last year. More of an H-back type.</p><p><strong>207)Buffalo Bills, WR Isaiah Hodgins, Oregon State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: At 6-4, has the size, but ran a 4.61 40. Not bad taking a shot on a tall receiver this late. Had 13 TDs last season.</p><p><strong>208)Green Bay Packers, C Jake Hanson, Oregon. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Packers not exactly lighting things up, but they need some depth. Hamson is athletic and well, struggled at times with snaps. A-Rod must be thrilled.</p><p><strong>209)Green Bay Packers, OT Simon Stepaniak, Indiana. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Very strong in the weight room with 37 reps at the combine. Doesn't always show that on the field. Could move inside at 6-4, 313. Tough run blocker.</p><p><strong>210)Philadelphia Eagles, OT Prince Tega Wanogho, Auburn. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Not a bad pick here. Wanogho could gain some bulk at 6-5, 309. Not very long and has the athletic ability of a guard. But he does have upside at guard. If he can improve technique, has a shot.</p><p><strong>211)Indianapolis Colts, S Isaiah Rodgers, UMass. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: First of three straight picks. Rodgers is 5-10, 170 pounds and a safety. Ouch. But he can return kickoffs and punts. Makes more sense.</p><p><strong>212)Indianapolis Colts, WR Dezmon Patmon, Washington State. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Second of three straight picks for Colts. Patmon is 6-4, 225 and runs a 4.48 40. He is not a consistent receiver, which is why he was available.</p><p><strong>213)Indianapolis Colts, ILB Jordan Glasgow, Michigan. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Smallish linebacker at 6-1, 226 pounds. A former walk-on. Most like a special teams player. Overachiever.</p><p><strong>214)Seattle Seahawks, WR Freddie Swain, Florida. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Another guy who can return punts. That's what you do in late rounders. Has good speed and can play some slot.</p><p><h4></h4></p><p><h4><strong>Seventh Round</strong></h4></p><p><strong>215)Cincinnati Bengals, LB Markus Bailey, LB Purdue. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good value here. Bailey is 6-1, 235 with a 4th-5th round value. Not great size, but at this point, you take what you can get. The issue? He suffered a torn ACL twice in his in college career to both legs. If not for that, he would be a mid-round pick.</p><p><strong>216)Washington Redskins, S Kamren Curl, Arkansas. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Curl is 6-1, 206 and has long arms. Just not very fast. Doesn't have great physical tools. But plays hard and has good instincts. The physical tools are not enough to make him a starter. Will have to make it on special teams.</p><p><strong>217)San Francisco 49ers, WR Jauan Jennings, Tennessee. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Last pick for the 49ers and they got a big receiver who is 6-3, 215. Loves to catch the ball in traffic and is a powerful runner. But runs a 4.72 40. Not going to outrun people.</p><p><strong>218)New York Giants, Edge Carter Coughlin, Minnesota. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Giants own the seventh round with four picks. Not sure that's a good thing. Coughlin is 6-3, 236, and can get to the passer. Not good size. Might end up at the "Sam" linebacker spot. No relation to former coach Tom Coughlin.</p><p><strong>219)Baltimore Ravens, S Geno Stone, Iowa. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens trade into the draft to get Stone, who was a two-year starter. Pretty good pick here as he projected to be a 4th or 5th rounder. Average size at 5-10, 207. Speed is ordinary at 4.62 in the 40 and short arms. But good instincts.</p><p>Will need to play Teams to make it.</p><p><strong>220)LA Chargers, WR K.J. Hill, Ohio State. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Did everybody get drafted on Ohio State? Hill is a solid pick for this late. He's not very fast (4.6 40) with short arms, but at around 6-0, 196, makes plays and is shifty. He's more quick than fast which likely means he'll have to make it as a slot receiver.</p><p><strong>221)Carolina Panthers, CB Stantley Thomas-Oliver III, FIU. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Well, he does have three first names. Do you think the Panthers focused on defense? Every pick was on the defensive end. Thomas-Oliver is 6-0, 192 and has some good instincts in coverage. Not great hands but 4.48 speed. That makes it worth it this late.</p><p><strong>222)Arizona Cardinals, RB Eno Benjamin, Arizona State. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a strong pick for the Cards, who had a decent draft. Benjamin is 5-9, 207 and has a chance to be a third-down back.</p><p><strong>223)Jacksonville Jaguars, CB Chris Claybrooks, Memphis. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Small corner at 5-9, 177. But he does have good speed and can return kicks. Former receiver who is still learning the position. Will have to make the team as a return man.</p><p><strong>224)Tennessee Titans, QB Cole McDonald, Hawaii. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: McDonald is 6-3, 215 and is a pretty good athlete. He ran a 4.58 40, which is actually faster than Jalen Hurts. What does that mean? Not much. His long delivery is a concern. Stats are inflated in Hawaii's offense. But as a developmental player, this isn't a bad pick.</p><p><strong>225)Minnesota Vikings, Edge Kenny Willekes, Michigan State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Willekes is 6-3, 264 with below average speed for an Edge (4.87). Has short arms, but plays the run well and is relentless. Oh yes, he has a motor. Of course, that's code for doesn't have great athletic numbers. Will be tough to make the team considering the Vikes have 15 picks. But is a solid pick late in the round.</p><p><strong>226)Chicago Bears, OT Arlington Hambright, Colorado. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments: A former juco prospect who will have to move to guard. Was hurt in 2018. Pretty raw.</p><p><strong>227)Chicago Bears, OG Lachavious Simmons, Tennessee State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: A 6-5, 304 pound guard with long arms. Pretty raw, but good thing is he played every position on the line except for center. That could help him make the team.</p><p><strong>228)Atlanta Falcons, P Sterling Hofrichter, Syracuse. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: This is where you should pick a punter. A consistent punter with good hangtime, who can also kick off when necessary.</p><p><strong>229)Washington Redskins, Edge James Smith-Williams, NC State. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-4, 265 with a 4.60 40 time. Very smart player off the field, but also has injury history. Fortunately, he can always use his tools in the classroom to become a success off the field.</p><p><strong>230)New England Patriots, C Dustin Woodard, Memphis. Grade: D+</strong></p><p>Comments: Last pick for the Pats, who had an interesting draft. They didn't take a quarterback and traded out of the first round. Woodard is undersized at 6-1, 295 and was a reach here.</p><p><strong>231)Dallas Cowboys, QB Ben DiNucci, James Madison. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Athletic quarterback who was accurate. More of a read-option threat at JMU. At best, he's a backup.</p><p><strong>232)Pittsburgh Steelers, DT Carlos Davis, Nebraska. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Davis ran a 4.82 40 at 313 pounds. His brother Khalil is a better prospect and was drafted earlier by Tampa Bay. Raw but worth a look here.</p><p><strong>233)Philadelphia Eagles, Edge Casey Toohill, Stanford. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Fits as a 3-4 outside linebacker at 6-4, 250) Good burst and closing speed. Can get pushed around. But has pass rush potential.</p><p><strong>234)LA Rams, LB Clay Johnston, Baylor. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Athletic linebacker who is coming off a knee injry last year and foot injuries in previous seasons. Not a bad gamble late.</p><p><strong>235)Detroit Lions, DT Jashon Cornell, Ohio State, Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Had four sacks last year in first season as a starter. Lacks size, but has some upside.</p><p><strong>236)Green Bay Packers, S Vernon Scott, TCU. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Scott has cover skills and is solid in run support. But didn't make enough plays to really be considered.</p><p><strong>237)Kansas City Chiefs, CB Bopete Keyes, Tulane. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-1, 202 and can match up with bigger receivers. Needs some work but a solid pick here.</p><p><strong>238)New York Giants, ILB South Carolina. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: At this point, if you can get an experienced linebacker who is a very good tackler, you take your chances and hope he can play special teams.</p><p><strong>239)Buffalo Bills, CB Dane Jackson, Pittsburgh. Grade:D</strong></p><p>Comments: Average size at 6-0, 187. Not very fast and not a ballhawk. Ran a 4.57 40 at the combine. Just might not have the quickness to make it. Will have to play teams.</p><p><strong>240)New Orleans Saints, QB Tommy Stevens, Mississippi State. Grade:</strong>D</p><p>Comments: Saints had just four picks. Stevens is 6-5, 235 and is athletic. But very much a developmental pick and not ready to take over for Drew Brees anytime soon.</p><p><strong>241)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, OLB Chapelle Russell, Temple. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Had ACL injuries in 2016 and 2017. Has good length and could make it as a backup. Not enough bulk to start.</p><p><strong>242)Green Bay Packers, DE Jonathan Garvin, Miami-Fl. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Raw selection. At 6-4, 263, has long frame and size. Good quickness and quickness. Like the pick.</p><p><strong>243)Tennessee Titans, CB Chris Jackson, Marshall. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Played for four seasons at Marshall. Not a lot of big plays. At 5-10, 183 with speed, he'll have a chance to make it as a nickel corner and on special teams.</p><p><strong>244)Minnesota Vikings, QB Nate Stanley, Iowa. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Stanley is an average athlete and a typical drop-back passer at 6-3, 235. Typical backup quarterback without great tools.</p><p><strong>245)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, RB Raymond Calais, Louisiana. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Smallish back but does run a 4.42 40. Can slash and return kicks. Has enough speed to stick.</p><p><strong>246)Miami Dolphins, WR Malcolm Perry, Navy. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: How can you not root for this guy. Perry was an option quarterback at Navy who ran for 4,359 yards. Not sure he can make the transition to wide receiver. But he has the speed and shiftiness to make people miss.</p><p><strong>247)NY Giants, CB Chris Williamson, Minnesota. Grade:D</strong></p><p>Comments: Is he a safety or a corner? That's never a good question to ask unless you're Xavier McKinney. His tackling is good enough to play safety and doesn't have the speed to play an outside corner.</p><p><strong>248)LA Rams, PK Sam Sloman, Miami (OH). Grade:D</strong></p><p>Comments: Not sure this is the guy to replace Greg "the Leg" Zuerlein. He doesn't have the leg. But had a good senior season and was accurate.</p><p><strong>249)Minnesota Vikings, S Brian Cole, Mississippi State. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: A former receiver and Michigan State transfer. A box safety with some size at 6-2, 213.</p><p><strong>250)LA Rams, OG Tremayne Anchrum, Clemson. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Played right tackle for Clemson, but should be a guard in the NFL. Nice pick here because he can certainly run block.</p><p><strong>251)Miami Dolphins, TE Stephen Sullivan, LSU. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: He's a former receiver at 6-5, who caught just 12 passes last season. Not sure why he was drafted other than he went to LSU.</p><p><strong>252)Denver Broncos, WR Tyrie Cleveland, Florida. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Another receiver for John Elway Cleveland caught just 25 passes as a senior, so he wasn't picked based on his college production.</p><p><strong>253)Minnesota Vikings, OG Kyle Hinton, Washburn. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Three-year starter with short arms. Going from Division II Washburn to the NFL is tough. But he did well at his Pro Day and is worth a look.</p><p><strong>254)Denver Broncos, OLB Derrek Tuszka, North Dakota State. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Comes from best FCS program in the nation. Decent size at 6-4, 251. Short arms for an OLB. Good instincts. Good pick here by Elway.</p><p><strong>255)New York Giants, LB Tae Crowder, Georgia. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Mr. Irrelvant plays the run well and is a high-effort (high-motor) play without great physical attributes. But has a chance of making the team.</p><p><em>(some info via ESPN.com)</em></p>
