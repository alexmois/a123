                        <p>Most sports have been put on hold at the moment, due to the pandemic. That means that Sports betters have not had much to bet on of late. Yes, the NBA held their HORSE competition and some have been making money on Horses and Esports but it is still not the same as betting on anything NFL related. Enter, the NFL Draft which begins on Thursday evening. This is a big week for both the league and the bettors that have been clamoring for something of substance to wager on. Be sure and check out my <a href="davids-top-five-nfl-draft-props__ca+162.html">Top 5 Draft Props</a>.</p><p>In this article, I will give you my Mock Draft of the first round. The draft will have a different look this year as all teams will be making their selections from home and Roger Goodell will be announcing each pick from his own basement. This is because all team facilities have been closed due to Covid-19. A virtual draft. This should be very interesting.</p><p><strong>1) Cincinnati Bengals - QB Joe Burrow, LSU</strong></p><p>There is no drama in this pick at all. The Bengals are going for Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy and a national title this year at LSU. He began his career at Ohio State before playing the last two years for the Tigers. In 2019, Burrow threw an amazing 60 touchdown passes to just 6 INTs while compiling 5671 yards throwing on the year. As I said, this is an easy call for a Bengals team that was 30th in the league in scoring last year, putting up just 17.4 ppg.</p><p><strong>2) Washington Redskins - DL Chase Young, Ohio State</strong></p><p>Many feel that Chase Young is the best player in the draft overall and he will go to the Redskins. That isn&rsquo;t something you say every year as the Skins have had some horrible first-round picks over the years. Last year for the Buckeyes, Young had 21 tackles for loss, 16.5 sacks, and seven forced fumbles. He is a wrecking ball upfront and the Skins did have their issues on defense last year as they were 27th in yards allowed and 27th in points allowed, giving up 27.2 ppg. We also note that the Skins could trade down in this spot and maybe the Dolphins or Chargers will trade up to get Tua Tagovailoa.</p><p><strong>3) Detroit Lions - CB Jeff Okudah, Ohio State</strong></p><p>Could the Lions trade this pick to the Bolts or Dolphins? That is a possibility as they could very well get Jeff Okudah a few picks later. Be on the lookout for a trade here. Still, this is a player the Lions want. Last year, he had three INTs and nine passes defended for the Buckeyes and he would help a Detroit team that was already 8th in the league against the pass last year. Okudah is compared to Jalen Ramsey, who has 10 INTs and 49 passes defended in his four-year career.</p><p><strong>4) New York Giants - OL Jedrick Wills Jr, Alabama</strong></p><p>Alabama always churns out good offensive linemen and Jedrick Wills Jr is the best in the draft. That&rsquo;s a good thing for the Giants as they need an OL badly, especially at the right tackle spot. The Giants were 20th in the league in getting sacked per game at 2.7 and they need to be able to protect Daniel Jones. The Giants also need to be able to open up holes for RB Saquon Barkley. Wills will be a great pick for the Giants.</p><p><strong>5) Maimi Dolphins - QB Justin Herbert, Oregon</strong></p><p>In my Draft Props article, I picked Tua Tagovailoa to go after the 5th pick and I will stick with that here. The Dolphins are in desperate need of a QB and Herbert fits the mold as a QB that is ready to make a splash in the NFL. He also has a bit of an edge over Tagovailoa, who has had some injury concerns in his career. Herbert Threw for 10,541 yards with 95 TDS and just 23 INTs over his four years at Oregon. This is an NFL ready QB and just the player the Dolphins need.</p><p><strong>6) Los Angeles Chargers - QB Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama</strong></p><p>It has been some time that the Chargers have needed to look for a QB in the first round as Philip Rivers has manned the spot for the last 14 years. Rivers is now off to Indianapolis and the Bolts have no choice but to select a top-notch QB in the 1st round. Tua Tagovailoa is just the guy the bolts need. Yes, he does have some injury concerns but Tua is ready for the NFL. He played in just nine games last year but still threw for 2840 yards with 33 TDs and just three INTs and if Tagovailoa can stay healthy, then he could be the perfect replacement for Rivers.</p><p><strong>7) Carolina Panthers - LB Isaiah Simmons, Clemson</strong></p><p>I know that some boards have the Panthers selecting Derrick Brown in this spot, but the feeling here is that Carolina needs to replace Luke Kuechly, who retired in the offseason. Kuechly was a disruptive force for the Panthers and Simmons has a chance to be the same. He had 16.5 tackles for loss, 8.0 sacks, 3 INTs, and 20 passed defended for the Clemson Tigers last year. He has a rare combination of power and speed. Brown is also a beast but he is a lineman and the Panthers need to replace their star LB that has retired.</p><p><strong>8) Arizona Cardinals - OL Tristan Wirfs, Iowa</strong></p><p>The Arizona Cardinals made many moves in the offseason to upgrade their offense and it will be one of the best in the league. They will continue to work on the offense by helping out their front line. Kyler Murray had a strong rookie season that saw him throw for 3722 yards and rush for 544 yards but he was sacked 48 times, which was the 3rd most in the league. Shoring up the OL is imperative if this offense is to take the next step and Wirfs can do that, especially at 6-5, 320 pounds.</p><p><strong>9) Jacksonville Jaguars - DT Derrick Brown, Auburn</strong></p><p>Many boards have Brown a bit higher than this but I see the Jags grabbing him in the 9th spot. Jacksonville does need a corner but they also need help upfront after ranking 31st in the league in rushing yards per attempt allowed at 5.1. The Jags were also 28th against the run, giving up 139.3 ypg a season ago. Brown has All-pro potential and is an impact run stuffer. He is the best defensive tackle in the draft and one of the top four or five players in the draft overall. This would be a big pick for the Jags.</p><p><strong>10) Cleveland Browns - OT Andrew Thomas, Georgia</strong></p><p>The Cleveland Browns are building a solid team and they have some very good offensive skill players. Now it&rsquo;s time to solidify the offensive line and they will do so with Andrew Thomas. He is big, strong and athletic, plus Thomas has a strong football IQ. Playing in the SEC against those defenses means that he should be ready for the NFL right from the start. Andrew will also be reunited with Nick Chubb and he opened some big holes for him when the pair were at Georgia.</p><p><strong>11) New York Jets - OT Mekhi Becton, Louisville</strong></p><p>With the loss of Robby Anderson, the Jets do need a wide receiver, but they are also looking for an offensive tackle and that is why they will select Mekhi Becton in this spot. He is massive at 6-7 360 pounds and will open lanes for a New York team that struggled to run the ball a year ago. Becton will also help protect Sam Darnold, who was sacked 40 times last year. Look for Mekhi do go in the 11th spot.</p><p><strong>12) Las Vegas Raiders - WR Ceedee Lamb, Oklahoma</strong></p><p>The Raiders are looking to add a wide receiver after TE Jared Cook led them in receiving last year with 896 yards. Jordy Nelson was 2nd with 723 yards, but he has since retired. Lamb is a speedy receiver and just the kind of guy that Gruden likes as he is also very tough. He had 2484 yards with 26 TDs in his last two years at Oklahoma and he will help a Las Vegas team that was 28th in the league in scoring at 18.1 ppg.</p><p><strong>13) San Francisco 49ers (From Indianapolis) - WR Henry Ruggs III, Alabama</strong></p><p>Jerry Jeudy had better stats than Ruggs at Alabama, but Henry has a bit more speed and the 49ers will be taking him because of that. The Niners have one of the best offenses in the league and they will continue to build on it, especially now that Tom Brady is now in the NFC. Ruggs could very well be the fastest player in the entire draft and the Niners used a speedy wideout to get them to the Super Bowl last year in Emmanuel Sanders. Henry could be the one that helps them win it this year.</p><p><strong>14) Tampa Bay Buccaneers - WR Jerry Jeudy, Alabama</strong></p><p>In my NFL Draft Props article, I had Lamb, Ruggs, & Jerry Jeudy being the first three wide receivers selected and in that order. Jeudy will complete the trifecta as he heads to Tampa Bay. Tom Brady had some solid WRs in his career at New England but the last couple of years that was not the case. Here in Tampa, he has Chris Goodwin and Rob Gronkowski, who just came out of retirement. Adding a solid receiver like Jeudy will give Brady another weapon to use against NFL defenses.</p><p><strong>15) Denver Broncos - WR Justin Jefferson, LSU</strong></p><p>A splurge on wide receivers continues as the Broncos should select Justin Jefferson from LSU. He had a monster season last year with 1540 yards and 18 TDs and will be just the target that Drew lock needs to get this offense rolling. Denver was 28th in the league in passing last year leading the team was Courtland Sutton with 1112 yards while 2nd was TE Noah Fant with 562 yards. This team needs another wideout.</p><p><strong>16) Atlanta Falcons - DB CJ Henderson, Florida</strong></p><p>The Flacons hope that they have shored up their running game with the addition of Todd Gurley and that will give them a more balanced attack. Now they have to work on their defense and CJ Henderson would be a great pick for them. He does have some issues locating the ball down the field and didn&rsquo;t intercept a single pass in his junior season at Florida but was still named to the ALL-SEC squad. In the right system, he will flourish.</p><p><strong>17) Dallas Cowboys - S Xavier McKinney, Alabama</strong></p><p>The Cowboys are looking for some help in their defensive backfield and Xavier McKinney will provide that help. He is a smart player with great instincts and he played many different positions in Nick Saban&rsquo;s defense. The Cowboys must replace Byron Jones and McKinney just may be the one to do it.</p><p><strong>18) Miami Dolphins (From Pittsburgh) - DT Javon Kinlaw, South Carolina</strong></p><p>The Dolphins helped the offense with their first pick in the draft and now they will look to give the defense some help. Javon Kinlaw hasn&rsquo;t reached his full potential yet but the Dolphins will not be contenders this year ay and that gives him some time to grow, This would be a great pick for a Miami team that was 30th in ypg allowed and 32nd in points allowed last year at 30.9 ppg.</p><p><strong>19) Las Vegas Raiders (From Chicago) - DE K'Lavon Chaisson, LSU</strong></p><p>With their first pick in this round, the raiders will have worked on their offense, so it makes sense to grab a nice defensive player with this one. Chaisson is a pure speed rusher on the edge and he will help a Las Vegas team that was 26th in the league in sacks per game at 2.0. He is tough and physical, along with speedy, and that makes him a great pick for the Raiders here.</p><p><strong>20) Jacksonville Jaguars (From The LA Rams) - QB Jordan Love, Utah</strong></p><p>The Jaguars need a QB that can Backup Gardner Minshew and Jordan Love could very well be the guy. He is not ready to go at the moment but he will learn at Jacksonville and will be ready when they need him. Love is loaded with the traits of today&rsquo;s kind of QB. He is a gunslinger but also has the athletic ability to be a dual-threat QB. Love would be a nice selection for the Jags here, especially since Nick Foles has moved on.</p><p><strong>21) Philadelphia Eagles - CB Jaylon Johnson, Utah</strong></p><p>The Eagles need a WR but the top four in the draft should all be gone by now and there is so much depth at the position in the draft that Philly can wait till the 2nd round to grab a solid one. The Egles have a solid run defense so they will work on getting help to a pass defense that was 19th in yards allowed last year. Johnson had six INTs the last two years for the Utes and he returned two of them for TDs.</p><p><strong>22) Minnesota Vikings (From Buffalo) - DL Marlon Davidson, Auburn</strong></p><p>The Vikings slipped some on defense last year so they will look to re-invigorate that side of the ball. Marlon Davidson is a solid lineman from Auburn. He is quick and is very good at shooting the gaps. He has had some issues at rushing the passer but under Zimmer&rsquo;s tutelage, he will learn that very quickly.</p><p><strong>23) New England Patriots - DT Ross Blacklock, Iowa</strong></p><p>The Patriots could use some help on offense, especially after Brady left for Tampa Bay, Still, it appears they will look to win with defense this year and that makes Ross Blacklock a solid choice in this spot. He missed all of 2018 due to injury but was named to the All-Big 12 team a year ago and he will help a New England team that was 1st in the league in yards and points allowed last year. This defense just gets scarier.</p><p><strong>24) New Orleans Saints - LB Patrick Queen, LSU</strong></p><p>The Saints have plenty of talent on offense so they will work on shoring up their defense a bit. Patrick Queen is one of the best LBs in the draft and the Saints do need help at that position. He&rsquo;s an ultra-athletic, linebacker with true sideline-to-sideline range while having strong change of direction skills. The player that the Saints need.</p><p><strong>25) Minnesota Vikings - CB Trevon Diggs, Alabama</strong></p><p>The Vikings will continue to work on their defense. They were 6th in the league in points allowed but 15th against the pass and Trevon Diggs would be a big help to their secondary. He is also the younger brother of Vikings WR Stefon Diggs. Trevon does need some sanding Around the edges but he has a combination of size, athleticism, and speed that doesn't come around often.</p><p><strong>26) Miami Dolphins (From Houston) - WR Brandon Aiyuk, Arizona State</strong></p><p>Whether it is Justin Herbert or Tua Tagovailoa, the Dolphins will be set at QB. Now they need someone to throw the ball to and I see them selecting WR Brandon Aiyuk in this spot. He&rsquo;s fast, physical, and ultra-competitive, plus he is one of the best receivers at running after the catch. Aiyuk had 1192 yards and eight TDs for the Sun Devils last year while averaging 18.3 yards per catch.</p><p><strong>27) Seattle Seahawks - EDGE Yetur Gross-Matos - Penn State</strong></p><p>The Seahawks are in need of a pass rusher and they look to shore that area up with the selection of Yetur Gross-Matos from Penn State. He is a strong edge rusher that had 95 sacks for the Nittany Lions last year and he will help a Seattle team that was 24th in sacks per game at 2.1.</p><p><strong>28) Baltimore Ravens - RB Jonathan Taylor, Wisconsin</strong></p><p>The Ravens are all about rushing the ball and they set many records in that department last year. I like this pick as it adds depth and he will be able to give Mark Ingram a break. Plus, Lamar Jackson can&rsquo;t keep rushing for 1200 yards in a season. Taylor is a powerful back and could be used a lot in this offense.</p><p><strong>29) Tennessee Titans - OL Isaiah Wilson, Georgia</strong></p><p>The Tennessee Titans have a strong running game and now they will look to help it out by selecting OL Isaiah Wilson from Georgia. He has outstanding physical traits and above-average potential overall. He has good torque power to widen lanes with kick-out blocks and that could help Henry have another huge season, after rushing for 1504 yards last year.</p><p><strong>30) Green Bay Packers - WR Jalen Reagor, TCU</strong></p><p>The Packers have had some great receivers over the years and they could be looking to add another one with the selection of WR Jalen Reagor. He caught just 43 passes for 611 yards last year at TCU, but he also had 72 receptions for 1061 yards back in 2018. He would be a nice compliment to Davante Adams, who led the team in receiving last year with 997 yards.</p><p><strong>31) San Francisco 49ers - CB AJ Terrell, Clemson</strong></p><p>The Niners have plenty of offensive weapons, so I will look for them to work on the defense in this late first-round selection. AJ Terrell is a long-armed corner and will help add some depth to an already strong San Francisco secondary. The Niners were 1st against the pass in the regular season but they also allowed the Chiefs 268 yards passing in the Super Bowl loss. The Niners need some depth in the secondary.</p><p><strong>32) Kansas City Chiefs - OL Cesar Ruiz, Michigan</strong></p><p>When you win the Super Bowl, you get the last pick in the first round. The Chiefs will most likely use this pick to add some depth to their offensive line. The Chiefs do need to make sure that they are protecting Patrick Mahomes, who has become the best QB in the league. Ruiz makes plenty of sense here.</p>
