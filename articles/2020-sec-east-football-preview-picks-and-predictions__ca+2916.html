                        <p>The Southeastern Conference is about ready to kick-off in late September with a conference schedule that will include 10 games and end with a conference championship. I&rsquo;ll take a look at each team and their chances to win their division this season starting with the SEC East.</p><p><em>(odds from Betonline.ag)</em></p><p>1)Florida Gators</p><p>Last year: 11-2 SU (6-2 SEC), 8-5 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 6 offense, 5 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: +105</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>Florida returns quarterback Kyle Trask, who threw for 2,941 yards with 25 TDs and just seven picks as a junior. The Gators averaged 300.8 passing yards and 129.8 rushing yards, so they went from a balanced attack to a pass-heavy attack-and it worked. They also return outstanding wide receiver Kyle Pitts, who caught 54 passes for 649 yards and five TDs. The key will be their performance against Georgia, who they have lost three straight games. Defensively, they lost a ton of talent (CB CJ Henderson), but they usually have a strong unit. The concern is the defensive line, with three new starters.</p><p><em>Prediction: First place in the SEC East</em></p><p><strong>2)Georgia Bulldogs</strong></p><p>Last year: 12-2 SU (7-1 SEC), 8-6 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 2 offense, 8 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: -135</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: WR Dominick Blaylock (knee) is out for the season. QB Jamie Newman (foot) is questionable for the opener. QB J.T. Daniels (knee) is questionable for the opener.</p><p>Georgia has numerous questions on offense. It starts at quarterback where <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29795338/sources-georgia-bulldogs-qb-jamie-newman-opts-prep-nfl-draft">Jamie Newman</a> is expected to start. He&rsquo;ll add more of a running dimension to an offense that could use it. The Wake Forest grad transfer is dealing with a foot injury, while USC transfer J.T. Daniels also has a knee injury. Newman threw for 2,693 yards with 23 TDs and 10 picks, while rushing for 487 yards for the Demon Deacs last season. However, Newman just announced on Wednesday that he will opt out this season due to COVID-19 concerns and to prepare for the NFL Draft. Daniels threw for 2,672 yards with 14 TDs and 10 picks in 2018-19 for the Trojans. New offensive coordinator Todd Monken will have talent, but his work cut out for him with so many new players and injuries. On defense, the Bulldogs lose some talent up front, but they have talent everywhere. They also used a lot of players at linebacker and the secondary is stacked.</p><p><em>Prediction: 2nd place in the SEC East</em></p><p><strong>3)Tennessee Vols</strong></p><p>Last year: 8-5 SU (5-3 SEC), 7-6 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 9 offense, 5 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: +1200</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: RG Cade Mays (elig.) is out for the season. TE Austin Pope (back) is questionable for the opener.</p><p>The Vols are back and it&rsquo;s nice to see. This is a program that has the facilities and 102,000+ seats to fill (well, maybe not this season). They should be better than just mediocre. This season, Jeremy Pruitt returns his quarterback Jarrett Guarantano, who lost his job last season, but came on strong at the end. He threw for 2,158 yards with 16 TDs and 8 picks. Brian Mauer and J.T. Shrout are also capable starters. They lose their top receiver but bring in freshman Jalin Hyatt, who has turned some heads early on. Running back Ty Chandler (655 yards), leads a solid group of runners, but they need to improve overall (4.1ypc). The defense returns just five starters, but they have to replace edge rusher Darrell Taylor (16.5 sacks). That&rsquo;s a big loss as well as leading tackler Daniel Bituli. They allowed 194 passing yards last season and it will difficult to improve on that this season with the loss of elite safety Nigel Warrior (4 INTs).</p><p><em>Prediction: 3rd SEC East</em></p><p><strong>4)Kentucky Wildcats</strong></p><p>Last year: 8-5 SU (3-5 SEC), 10-3 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 8 offense, 7 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: +1400</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: LB Chris Oats (undisclosed) is out for the season.</p><p>The Wildcats were the top team against the spread last season and had some pretty good wins, including a 37-30 victory over Virginia Tech in the Belk Bowl. The big question is at quarterback (for a change) as Terry Wilson is back after missing most of last season with a knee injury. Sawyer Smith replaced him and he also suffered through several injuries. They were hoping that Auburn transfer Joey Gatewood would be eligible, but that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case. The good news is that they have a lot of experience returning, including RB Asim Rose (826yds). The offensive line should be very strong, possibly the best in the division. Defensively, they ranked 5th in the SEC (324.6ypg) and 1st against the pass (167.8ypg). However, they struggled against the run, allowing 4.6 yards per carry.</p><p><em>Prediction: 4th in SEC East</em></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5)Missouri</strong></p><p>Last year: 6-6 SU (3-5 SEC), 4-8 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 4 offense, 7 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: +2500</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: TE Darrell Parker Jr. (eye) is out indefinitely.</p><p>Missouri will turn to Eli Drinkwitz as head coach. He went 13-1 as Appalachian State head coach in one season aid is now in the SEC. The first-year coach is an offensive guru, taking over for Barry Odom. It all starts at quarterback where Shawn Robinson, a TCU transfer, was looking to hold off three other quarterbacks. Robinson threw for 1,334 yards in 2018 before getting hurt. He should be the right guy for an uptempo offense utilized by Gus Malzahn at Auburn. They will have to rebuild on offense with four returning starters. They should have a solid defense, with seven back. They allowed just 312 yards per game last season to rank third in the SEC and 14 in the nation. They also led the nation in allowing just a 50.3% completion rate, despite lacking a strong pass rush.</p><p><em>Prediction: 5th in SEC East</em></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>6)South Carolina</strong></p><p>Last year: 4-8 SU (3-5 SEC), 5-7 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 6 offense, 6 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: +2500</p><p>Key opt outs: OL Jordan Rhodes</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>This is a big year for Will Muschamp and the Gamecocks. Muschamp is 26-25 after four years, so it&rsquo;s time to start winning. Mike Bobo as the new offensive coordinator should help to infuse some life into an offense that ranked near the bottom of the SEC in most categories. The quarterback race features sophomore Ryan Hilinski (2,357 yds, 11 TDs, 5 INTs) and RB MarShawn Lloyd, a talented freshman. The defense returns six starters from a unit that got destroyed last season, especially against the run (158ypg). The secondary will be the strength of the defense, led by junior corners Jaycee Horn and Israel Mukuamu, but after that, there are many questions.</p><p><em>Prediction: 6th SEC East</em></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>7)Vanderbilt</strong></p><p>Last year: 3-9 SU (1-7 SEC), 3-9 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 5 offense, 11 defense</p><p>SEC East Champion: +5000</p><p>Key opt outs: OL Cole Clemens.</p><p>Key injuries: OL Jon Stewart (personal) is out for the season.</p><p>The Commodores are hoping to turn things around for coach Derek Mason, who added six new assistants including OC Todd Fitch and DC Ted Roof. But the bottom line is that talent wins games and Vandy usually can&rsquo;t compete with the big boys in the SEC. At quarterback, the Commodores have to start over. Riley Neal is gone, so transfer Jeremy Moussa and freshman Ken Seals will battle it out. They ranked near the bottom of the nation in just about every offensive category and didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot better on defense. The good news is that everybody is back on defense, but that might not be enough.</p><p><em>Prediction: Last SEC East</em></p>
