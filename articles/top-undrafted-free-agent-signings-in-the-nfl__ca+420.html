                        <p>Things are starting to look better in regards to the sporting world right now as we start to hear positive news about things. While the NFL is still the farthest off in regards to getting the season started, there has been no shortage of news recently. The draft took place at the end of last month and we saw some surprises during that, both in some of the selections and trades that took place. With the draft in the rear view mirror, that left some very good players that slipped through the cracks, either due to teams picking options that filled a need for them or for a variety of different other reasons.</p><p>Today, we&rsquo;ll take a look at 10 of the top guys that weren&rsquo;t drafted but earned a contract as an undrafted free agent, giving them a chance to keep their dreams of being a NFL player alive.</p><p><strong>TE Hunter Bryant: </strong>The junior tight end from Washington was expected to be a potential third-round pick heading into the draft and should have been a day three pick at worst. He was a valuable target in the Huskies&rsquo; passing game last season, hauling in 52 passes for 825 yards and three scores. Bryant finished <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/hunter-bryant-2.html">ninth in the Pac-12 in receiving yards</a> and seventh in yards per catch in 2019, making him a solid option in the middle of the field. Those numbers made him a first-team Pac-12 and a second-team All-American while earning a finalist bid for the John Mackey Award. He was a nice pickup for the Lions, who can pair him or give him some time to develop behind last season&rsquo;s first-round pick, T.J. Hockenson.</p><p><strong>IOL Calvin Throckmorton: </strong>Throckmorton was a four-year starter on the offensive line for Oregon and played guard, center and tackle. His size (6&rsquo;5, 317 pounds) is solid for an offensive lineman and he showed versatility in college. The biggest issue for Throckmorton was a dismal showing at the scouting combine. He turned in a 5.57 40 time and had only 23 reps on the bench press. Despite those numbers, he was a third-team All-American and a first-team Pac-12 selection. This pickup was a solid one for the Saints, who need offensive line depth, and it helped offset the fact that they had only four draft picks.</p><p><strong>QB Josh Love: </strong>Love may have been lost in the shuffle a bit, especially as he was viewed as the second-best QB with the surname Love in this draft. His career was off to a slow start before getting the starting job and carrying it from beginning to end in 2019 at San Jose State. He responded with a career year as he hit 293 of 481 passes for 3,923 yards with 22 touchdown passes and eight interceptions. For his efforts, he earned Offensive Player of the Year in the Mountain West Conference in 2019 and was also a first-team All-Mountain West selection. Love will be solidly in the mix battling for a backup role behind Jared Goff with the Rams.</p><p><strong>QB Anthony Gordon: </strong>Gordon posted some massive numbers last season playing in the Air Raid offense of Mike Leach at Washington State. He lit up opposing defenses by hitting 493 of 689 passes last season for a staggering 5,579 yards with 48 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. Gordon led the nation in completions, pass attempts, passing yards and touchdowns while ranking fourth in completion percentage. Seattle inked him to potentially be the backup to Russell Wilson and give the Seahawks a big arm to utilize in certain situations if they need to fire up a deep ball.</p><p><strong>QB Tyler Huntley</strong>: There were several quarterbacks that slipped through the cracks a bit in this draft and <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/tyler-huntley-1.html">Huntley</a> fits that bill. He hit 220 of 301 passes for 3,092 yards with 19 touchdowns and four interceptions for the Utes last season while adding 290 yards and five scores on the ground. Huntley was second in the NCAA in completion percentage, behind only LSU&rsquo;s Joe Burrow, and earned a first-team Pac-12 selection for his efforts. If there&rsquo;s a team that knows how to utilize a dual-threat quarterback, it&rsquo;s Baltimore: after all, Lamar Jackson won the MVP last season and the backup is a former Heisman winner in Robert Griffin III. He should have a chance to make some impact here, perhaps in a Taysom Hill-like role.</p><p><strong>CB Essang Bassey: </strong>Bassey slipped on draft boards after being lit up during the Senior Bowl. However, that&rsquo;s not the fairest way to evaluate his college career given the fact that the defensive system that was played differed from what he did in college. He has solid speed with a 4.46 40 time and has a solid vertical (39.5 inches) to help offset the fact that he&rsquo;s only 5&rsquo;9 and 191 pounds. Bassey finished with 60 tackles (41 solo), one interception, one fumble recovery and 11 pass defenses last season. He was a third-team All-ACC selection last season. In his career, he had 227 tackles (161 solo), five picks, one forced fumble, three fumble recoveries and 45 pass defenses. Denver was in need of some help in the secondary, so he should be able to fight for a spot.</p><p><strong>CB Parnell Motley: </strong>Motley was a decent option on several teams&rsquo; draft boards but it&rsquo;s unclear what made him slip down the rankings. He has the penchant for being around the ball and making plays when his team needs one. In his career, Motley recorded 33 pass defenses and six interceptions. Last season, he forced five fumbles to go with 41 tackles and 13 pass defenses. He&rsquo;ll need to work on his strength to be able to make plays against the run but his ability to make plays around the ball is an advantage that can&rsquo;t be overlooked. Tampa Bay can use playmakers in the secondary and Motley should get a chance to foot the bill.</p><p><strong>RB J.J. Taylor: </strong>The biggest reason why Taylor wasn&rsquo;t drafted is evident when you look at him. He&rsquo;s just 5&rsquo;6 (and that might be in cleats) and 185 pounds, making him more of a scatback like Dave Meggett than an every-down type of back. His production dropped nearly in half from his junior season, when he ran 255 times for 1,434 yards and six scores. Last season, he had 148 carries for 721 yards and five touchdowns though he did add 32 receptions for 289 yards out of the backfield. Taylor could be another pass-catching back for the Patriots, much like James White has been in recent seasons.</p><p><strong>TE Thaddeus Moss: </strong>Moss started his career at NC State before transferring to LSU, where he was a weapon on the national title-winning team last season. He reeled in 47 balls for 570 yards and four scores last season but was definitely a few rungs down the pecking order for the national champs, who were loaded offensively. Still, Mos, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Randy Moss, slipped mainly due to <a href="https://walterfootball.com/wu2020tmoss.php">medical concerns</a> about a foot injury. He didn&rsquo;t get a chance to perform at the combine or at pro day, which may have scared some teams off. Others had concerns about his frame (6&rsquo;2, 250) and potential durability issues. Washington had a glaring need at tight end after Jordan Reed&rsquo;s career was derailed by concussions and Vernon Davis retired. He&rsquo;ll get plenty of chances to make an impact.</p><p><strong>OT Trey Adams: </strong>Another guy that had plenty of high praise before being derailed by injuries, Adams was a solid offensive lineman that was overlooked. He has plenty of size at 6&rsquo;8, 318 and if he can stay healthy, he could be a steal. Originally compared to Taylor Lewan, Adams suffered through a torn ACL in 2017 and a back issue that cost him all but four games in 2018. He bounced back last season, playing in every game for Washington and earning a first-team Pac-12 selection for his efforts. The injury concerns led to several teams flunking him medically on their boards but he found a good landing spot. Going to Buffalo behind a veteran offensive line that could use some youthful depth pieces could give Adams a chance to be a valuable swing tackle to gain experience.</p><p><strong>Honorable Mention</strong>: QB Steven Montez (Colorado), RB Artavis Pierce Jr. (Oregon State), LB Joe Bachie (Michigan State), K Rodrigo Blankenship (Georgia), WR Binjimen Victor (Ohio State), TE Jacob Breeland (Oregon)</p>
