                        <p>The 2020 NFL season is still expected to start on time, which is September 10th. Let&rsquo;s all hope that it plays out as expected. There could be fans in the stands but the NFL is currently considering the idea of having fans sign a COVID-19 waiver in order to get into the stadiums. That would prevent the Owners from getting sued should any fans get sick.</p><p>The NFL Schedule was released a couple of months ago and so I have been going over the Win Totals for each team, by division. Today I will tackle the NFC South and below you can find the other win total previews I have done so far.</p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-totals-nfc-east__ca+1906.html">NFC East</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-north__ca+1907.html">NFC North</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-west__ca+1915.html">NFC West</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-east__ca+1917.html">AFC East</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-north__ca+1918.html">AFC North</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-south__ca+1919.html">AFC South</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-west__ca+1920.html">AFC West</a><br /><br /></p><p><br />All Win Totals & Odds Are Courtesy Of <a href="https://www.betonline.ag/sportsbook/futures-and-props/nfl-team-wins">Betonline.ag</a></p><p><br /><br /><strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 7.5 (-130), Under 7.5 (+100)</strong></p><p>The Atlanta Falcons began last year at 1-7 but they turned it on in the 2nd half of the season going 6-2 over their last eight games. They finished the season at just 7-9 but it could have been worse. Atlanta has a dynamite passing game but the\y have been lacking in the run department. The Falcons hope that they have corrected that by trading for Todd Gurley (LA Rams). Gurley struggled last year with injuries but he did combine for 2526 yards and 30 TDs in his previous two years. Atlanta was 30th in rushing a year ago, compared to 3rd in passing. A more balanced offense will help them out greatly. The defense was an issue for the Falcons but hey upgrade all three levels of the defense through the draft or free agency. It will be improved this year. The home slate for the Falcons is not too daunting as they have games against Seattle, Chicago, Carolina, Detroit, Denver, Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Tampa Bay. Seattle and their last two games are the toughest for them but still, it looks as if they could easily go 6-2 at home. The road slate is not easy at all as the Falcons have games at Dallas, Green Bay, Minnesota, Carolina, New Orleans, LA Chargers, Kansas City and Tampa Bay. They should beat Carolina at home and I will call for them to pull at least one upset in the other games. This is not a playoff team but they should at least go 8-8. <strong>Prediction: Atlanta Over 7.5 (-130).</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 5.5 (-110), Under 5.5 (-120)</strong></p><p>The Carolina Panthers had a very rough 5-11 season last year and this year does not promise to be a whole lot better for them. The offense has a shot at being better with the addition of Teddy Bridgewater at QB, while still having Christian McCaffery at RB and DJ Moore, along with Robby Anderson at WR. Still, the offensive line is a Mess and Bridgewater is not the QB he was before the injury hit. This offense will also be going through scheme changes now that Matt Rhule is the new head coach. The defense lost its heart and soul when Luke Kuechly retired, but they did work on their defense by using all seven draft picks on that side of the ball. The Carolina Panthers still have a long way to go to reach respectability but they did take some steps in the right direction. Their home slate includes games against Las Vegas, Arizona, Chicago, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Detroit, Denver, and New Orleans. I see Las Vegas, Detroit, and possibly Denver as their wins at home. Whether they go 2-6 or 3-5 at home, the Panthers will not have enough wins to get the Over here. Their road slate is tough with games at Tampa Bay, LA Chargers, Atlanta, New Orleans, Kansas City, Minnesota, Green Bay, and Washington. There is no way the Panthers win three games on the road this year. Matt Rhule will have a tough 1st season as I see the Panthers going just 4-12 this year. <strong>Prediction: Carolina Under 5.5 (-130)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 10.5 (-115), Under 10.5 (-115)</strong></p><p>The New Orleans Saints are one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl this year and with good reason, as this team is loaded. The Saints did nothing to hurt themselves from a team that went 13-3 a year ago. They even made themselves better with the addition of WR Emmanuel Sanders, while also shoring up their offensive line with the selection of C/G Cesar Ruiz in the first round. The linebacking corps got an upgrade in the 3rd round with the drafting of Zack Braun from Wisconsin, who many felt is one of the biggest steals of the draft. He should play nicely alongside Kiko Alonso, who had his contract restructured this offseason. The secondary was a weak spot for the Saints last year but they did address that need through free agency with the signing of Malcolm Jenkins. This will be an improved defense. The Road slate is rather easy as it includes very winnable games against Las Vegas, Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, and Carolina. I can see the Saints going at least 5-3 on the road and that means they need to go 6-2 or better at home and they have gone 6-2 or better at home in each of their last three seasons. The home slate is rather tough as it includes games against Tampa Bay, Green Bay, the Chargers, Carolina, San Fran, Kansas City, Minnesota, and Atlanta. Still, The Saints will be able to squeeze at least six wins out of those games. At the very least, the Saints will go 11-5 this year. <strong>Prediction: New Orleans Over 10.5 (-115)</strong></p><p><br /><br /><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 9.5 (-130), Under 9.5 (+110)</strong></p><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a stellar offseason after going just 7-9 a season ago. They have upgraded their team on offense with the additions of Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, plus OT Tristan Wirfs through the draft. I know that the offense was strong last year with Jameis Winston throwing for over 5000 yards and 33 TDs but he also had 30 INTs as well. Brady will keep the mistakes to a minimum and that will make this offense far better than last year. The secondary is the big key after ranking 30th in pass defense a year ago and they didn&rsquo;t do a ton to upgrade it t his year. The run defense was the best in the league but that is a bit deceiving as the Bucs were 3rd in the league in rushing attempts per game against at 22.6, compared to passing attempts per game against at 41.5, which was last in the league. Why would teams run against the Bucs when they could have great success throwing against them? Tampa needs to shore up the secondary. The home slate is not all that easy. Yes, they have home games against Carolina, Atlanta the Chargers, and the Rams but they also have games against New Orleans, Kansas City, Green Bay, and Minnesota. I say no better than 5-3 at home. On the road, they have toughies against New Orleans, Denver, possibly Chicago and Atlanta, while also taking on Las Vegas, the Giants, Carolina, and Detroit. I will look for them to go no better than 4-4 on the road. It looks like just a 9-7 record for the Bucs this year and it will be their secondary that holds them back a bit. <strong>Prediction: Tampa Bay Under 9.5 (+110).</strong></p>
