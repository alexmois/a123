                        <p>I&rsquo;ll take a look at each team and their chances to win their division this season starting with the SEC West.</p><p><em>(odds from Betonline.ag)</em></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1)Alabama Crimson Tide</strong></p><p>Last year: 11-2 SU (6-2 SEC), 7-6 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 7 offense, 5 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: -220</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>Nick Saban is going to have his team prepared and it starts with a defense that brings back linebacker Dylan Moses and DE La Bryan Ray from injury. If healthy, Moses should be one of the best linebackers in the nation. Their defense was strong last season, ranking third in the SEC at 18.6ppg and 3rd in passing yards per game (187.2ypg). On offense, the Tide averaged 47.2 points per game (2nd overall), and 347.2 passing yards per game. Quarterback Mac Jones returns after tossing for 1,503 yards with 14 TDs in replacing the injured Tui Tagovailoa. WR Jaylen Waddle (33 catches, 7 TDs) teams with senior DeVonta Smith (68 catches, 1,256 yds, 14 TDs) to give them one of the best duos in the nation. RB Najee Harris (1,224 yds, 13 TDs) should have a monster year.</p><p><strong>Prediction: 1st SEC West</strong></p><p><strong>2)Auburn</strong></p><p>Last year: 9-4 SU (5-3 SEC), 9-4 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 3 offense, 4 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: +500</p><p>Key opt outs: LB Chandler Wooten.</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>The good news for Auburn is the return of quarterback Bo Nix, a sophomore who threw for 16 TDs on 57.6% completion rate as a freshman. WR Seth Williams (59 catches, 850 yds, 8 TDs) also returns, but there are concerns on the offensive line with five new starters. Defensively, they also have to replace DT Derrick Brown and some key players. They&rsquo;ll have to rely on their linebackers and some junior college transfers up front. If Auburn can protect Nix and emerge in a hurry, they should overtake LSU for the second spot in the West.</p><p><strong>Prediction: 2nd SEC West</strong></p><p><strong>3)LSU</strong></p><p>Last year: 15-0 SU (6-0 SEC), 10-5 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 2 offense, 5 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: +300</p><p>Key opt outs: WR Ja&rsquo;Marr Chase (84 catches last year), DE Neil Farrell, DT Tyler Shelvin, DB Kary Vincent.</p><p>Key injuries: CB Eli Ricks (shoulder) is ? LT Dare Rosenthal (personal) has taken a leave of absence from the program.</p><p>What a year for Ed Orgeron and the Tigers. They took the National title and went undefeated. But after winning the national title last season, LSU has a ton of losses, especially on offense. Replacing NFL first overall pick Joe Burrow is tough enough as junior Myles Brennan will have huge shoes to fill. They not only lose Burrow, but also coordinator Joe Brady. They have to replace four starting offensive linemen along with star RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire and star WRs Justin Jefferson (NFL) and Ja&rsquo;Marr Chase (sitting out). They&rsquo;ll still score some points, but will have to rely more on a defense that allowed 21.9 points per game and 222.7 yards in the air (59th). Sophomore CB Derek Stingley Jr. leads a defense that will move to a 4-3 scheme led by new coordinator Bo Pelini.</p><p><strong>Prediction: 3rd SEC West</strong></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong><strong>)Texas A&M Aggies</strong></strong></p><p>Last year: 8-5 SU (4-4 SEC), 7-6 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 8 offense, 8 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: +800</p><p>Key opt outs: DB Elijah Blades, QB James Foster, DB Derrick Tucker.</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>The Aggies return starting quarterback Kellen Mond, who struggled at times last season on the road and was very good at home. He threw for 2,897 yards with 20 TDs and nine picks, while rushing for 501 yards. He&rsquo;ll have plenty of weapons back including RB Isaiah Spiller (946 yards, 10 TDs) and WR Jhamon Ausbon (66 for 872 yards). They really need more big plays at receiver as they only had 10 pass plays that covered 30 yards or more. Ausbon had six of those. For the Aggies to compete for the elite, they need to improve their pass blocking up front. On defense, they ranked 7th in the SEC against the pass (209.5ypg) and 8th in overall defense (340.2ypg). They had to improve against the run (4.1ypc allowed) and need to force more turnovers (14 last season).</p><p><strong>Prediction: 4th in SEC West</strong></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong><strong>)Ole Miss</strong></strong></p><p>Last year: 4-8 SU (2-6 SEC), 7-5 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 6 offense, 6 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: +2500</p><p>Key opt outs: C Eli Johnson.</p><p>Key injuries: DE/LB Sam Williams (suspension) is out indef.</p><p>The Rebels hired Lane Kiffin to turn around their program, which has not had a winning season since 2015. It starts at quarterback where John Rhys Plumlee is back after averaging 113.7 rushing yards per game as a freshman to lead the SEC. Now, they need to improve a passing game that averaged just 194 yards per game in the air (102nd) and 26.6 points per game (82nd). Running the football is great and they have the talent led by Jerrion Ealy (894yds). They have quality experience on the offensive line and should be strong. The defense is another story as they were horrendous last season, especially against the pass (416.8ypg, 85th). The big worry is on the defensive line, where DE Sam Williams was suspended after recording six sacks and 9.5 tackles for loss as a juco transfer. Their strength is at linebacker led by senior MLB Lakia Henry (87 tackles). They return two starts in the secondary, but need some younger players to step up. The addition of Kiffin should be a boost, especially to the offense.</p><p><strong>Prediction: 5th in SEC West</strong></p><p><strong>6)Mississippi State</strong></p><p>Last year: 6-7 SU (3-5 SEC), 5-8 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 5 offense, 4 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: +2000</p><p>Key opt outs:CB Tyler Williams</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>Mike Leach heads to Starkville for his first season and brings the Air Raid offense with him. That means a lot of passing and Stanford transfer K.J. Costello appears to be the quarterback to take over. He threw for 6,151 yards with 49 TDs at Stanford, though injuries limited him to five games last season. He&rsquo;s the perfect fit for Leach&rsquo;s offense until they groom a younger passer. Sophomore Garrett Shrader did play last season and started four games (1,170 yds, 8 TDs, 5 INTs) and could be a fit. Poor Kylin Hill returns after rushing for 1,350 yards and 10 TDs last season to lead the SEC. Maybe Leach will become more balanced this season, with such a strong back, but doubt it. The defense will bring back just four starters and will have to get used to a 3-3-5 scheme. Last season, they finished 74th in points per game allowed at 28.8 and 97th against the pass (246.8ypg). The front three should be pretty good, but the secondary needs some help. MLB Erroll Thompson (84 tackles) leads the way for the Bulldogs&rsquo; defense. Will be a learning year.</p><p><strong>Prediction: 6th in SEC West</strong></p><p><strong>7)Arkansas Razorbacks</strong></p><p>Last year: 2-10 SU (0-8 SEC), 4-8 ATS</p><p>Returning starters: 8 offense, 6 defense</p><p>SEC West Champion odds: +8000</p><p>Key opt outs: none</p><p>Key injuries: none</p><p>Sam Pittman takes over a program that has lost 19 straight SEC games. At least they have chance against Ole Miss at home, Miss. State and Missouri on the road to break the streak. The good news is that senior Rakeem Boyd (1,133yds, 8 TDs) is back at running back. The Razorbacks averaged 147.2 yards per game on the ground (85th) and just 191.2ypg (103rd) in the air last season. More good news comes in the form of redshirt senior Feleipe Franks, who started 25 games for Florida from 2017-19. The offensive line has to improve up front to protect him. They have all three starting receivers back and that should help. Barry Odom takes over a defense that was atrocious last season. They ranked 124th in scoring defense (36.8ppg) and 122nd against the run (221.5ypg). Injuries hampered their progress up front as senior Dorian Gerald and sophomore Mataio Soli are both back at defensive end after injury-plagued seasons. The secondary loses senior Kamren Curl to the draft and that&rsquo;s a shame, though they have four other starters back from a 4-2-5 alignment. With Franks, they should at least win one SEC game this season.</p><p><strong>Prediction: 7th in SEC West</strong></p>
