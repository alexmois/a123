                        <p>NFL Preseason Recap for Week 2</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at last week&rsquo;s NFL preseason games with a betting angle.</p><p><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/1"><strong>Ben Hayes is rolling, going 13-5 over his last 18 picks and 10-4 over his last 14 football selections. Don't miss his discounted Football and Baseball packages as he's been one of the hottest handicappers on the Experts site!</strong></a></p><p>Thursday, August 17</p><p>Cleveland (+3.5/38) over PHILADELPHIA 18-18</p><p>A tie is like&hellip;In the preseason, nobody really cares if you win or lose. From a betting perspective, you&rsquo;ll take a tie if you have the dog. Cleveland rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson was 13 of 25 for 164 yards but no TDs or picks. The star on offense for Cleveland was Austin Watkins Jr. with 7 catches for 139 yards. Marcus Mariota was not very impressive for the Eagles with 86 yards passing (9-of-17) with one pick. Linebacker Nakobe Dean generated a turnover by knocking the ball loose from John Kelly Jr. at the goal line. The rookie second-rounder from Georgia is expected to win he Mike linebacker spot. . Neither team used their starters in this one.</p><p>Friday, August 18, 2023</p><p>Carolina (+3.5/37.5) over NY GIANTS 19-21</p><p>The Giants started Daniel Jones and used Tyrod Taylor in the first half at quarterback. It&rsquo;s no wonder why they jumped out to a 21-0 lead at the half and then went scoreless in the second half to miss the cover. Jones was very sharp, going 8-of-9 in 10 snaps. Three completions went to new tight end Darren Waller. As for the Panthers, Bryce Young completed 3 of 6 for 35 yards on two series (17 plays). His offensive line struggled to protect him for the second straight week and his receivers struggled with their routes. Second-round rookie receiver Jonathan Mingo struggled at times, but also caught one pass for 15 yards where he bounced off a tackler.</p><p>Cincinnati (+6.5/37.5) over ATLANTA 13-13</p><p>Yes, another tie. The Bengals scored just one touchdown and it came with 50 seconds left on a Chase Brown run. Cincy didn&rsquo;t play their starters and played well defensively. Rookie RB Bijan Robinson showed flashes with 20 yards on four carries along with a six-yard reception. QB Desmond Ridder completed 7 of 9 passes and had one pick that was a tipped by Joseph Assai. <br /><br /></p><p>Jacksonville (+4/39.5) over DETROIT 25-7</p><p>Teddy Bridgewater&rsquo;s debut didn&rsquo;t go as planned. Maybe he might want to drop 50 and go back to wearing No. 5. Number five was taken by new RB David Montgomery. Bridgewater went 5-for-11 for 34 yards and a fumble. The Jags may have found a stud in third-round pick Tank Bigsby, who ran for 70 yards on 13 carries. Trevor Lawrence didn&rsquo;t play, but Nathan Rourke continues to impress, going 10-of-12 for 121 yards. The Lions ran for just 35 yards on 19 carries so the Jags did the job on defense.</p><p>Saturday, August 19</p><p>Miami (+2) over HOUSTON 28-3</p><p>This was a complete mismatch as the Dolphins put up 21 points in the first half and never looked back. That&rsquo;s despite Tua Tagovailoa throwing a pick on his first attempt. He shook off the cobwebs after that completing 5 of 6 for 61 yards. Rookie QB C.J. Stroud was better this week despite some mistakes. He also wasn&rsquo;t helped by the fact that the Texans didn&rsquo;t allow young receivers Tank Dell and John Metchie to play. The good news is that cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. should make that jump in his second season to become a top corner.</p><p>PITTSBURGH (+1) over Buffalo 27-15</p><p>Even though this was preseason, this was an impressive performance by the Steelers and a sloppy on by the Bills. Buffalo committed 13 penalties, including five from the offensive line. The pass protection was poor for all the quarterbacks. Matt Barkley had a terrible game with three interceptions and a fumble. Kyle Allen completed 12 of 15 for 112 yards with a TD. Josh Allen started and completed 7 of 10 for 64 yards. Second-year QB Kenny Pickett led the Steelers to a TD on the first drive, which was anchored by a 62-yard Jaylen Warren. Pickett threw just four passes and was relieve by Mitch Trubisky, who completed 10 of 13 for 78 yards and a score.</p><p>INDIANAPOLIS (+4/37.5) over Chicago 24-17</p><p>Rookie QB Anthony Richardson did not play along with most of the starters. Backup Gardner Minshew was solid, completing 13 of 15 for 107 yards and a TD pass. Even third-string Sam Ehlinger played well, completing 9 of 14 for 124 yards. The Colts just signed veteran wide receiver James Washington, who caught a 42-yard pass from Ehlinger. Chicago did not start Justin Fields, so this was P.J. Walker&rsquo;s time to shine and he did not. Walker completed just 1 of 4 for 6 yards. Tyson Bagent, a Division II quarterback, took advantage of his playing time, completing 9 of 10 for 76 yards.</p><p>Tampa Bay (+3.5/37) over NY JETS 13-6</p><p>Neither team played their starters. Zach Wilson showed that he had the legs of a young Aaron Rodgers, rushing for 35 yards on a scramble. He completed 9 of 13 for 70 yards, but did nothing spectacular. This was a defensive battle and the Jets showed that their depth on the defensive line is strong. Kyle Trask got the starter for Tampa Bay and then had to re-enter the game when John Wolford got injured. Trask went 20 for 2 for 218 yards and a TD. His numbers could have been better if not for some drops. However, Baker Mayfield was named the starter for the regular season by Todd Bowles on Tuesday.</p><p>Kansas City (-7.5/41) over ARIZONA 38-10</p><p>This might be a sign of things to come for Arizona, especially without Kyler Murray. Patrick Mahomes got the start and was a pedestrian 10 of 15 for 105 yards with a TD. The rest of the quarterbacks went 21 of 23 for 288 yards with two TDs. Rookie WR Rashee Rice was impressive with eight catches for 96 yards. Rookie quarterback Clayton Tune won&rsquo;t start and has a ways to go. He went 12 of 24 for 133 yards with 35 yards rushing and showed flashes. But he could be a backup next season. Colt McCoy got the start and completed 5 of 8 for 25 yards. It&rsquo;s going to be a long season in Phoenix.</p><p>New England (+2.5/36.5) over GREEN BAY 21-17</p><p>This game was suspended in the fourth quarter after NE rookie CB Isaiah Bolden was taken off the field on a stretcher after a collision with a teammate. Fortunately, the injury was not serious though don't expect Bolden to play in Week 3. Bill Belichick decided to not tell anybody and start Mac Jones, who completed 6 of 9 for 52 yards. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack from the blind side. Green Bay QB Jordan Love went 5 for 85 yards with a TD after a slow start. Love has done well during this preseason. Green Bay wide receiver Romeo Doubs had a strong game with two catches for 52 yards as he continued his strong camp.</p><p>SAN FRANCISCO (+3/39.5) over Denver 21-20</p><p>Brock Purdue made his debut and played in his first game since suffering an elbow injury in the playoffs on Jan. 29. Purdy went 4 for 5 for 65 yards and was able to get the 49ers into field goal range. San Francisco played most of their starters with Purdy. Sam Darnold completed 11 of 14 for 109 yards with a TD and a pick. Trey Lance came on as the third quarterback and threw a terrible pick and another that was nearly picked off. However, he ended strong, going 12 of 18 for 173 yards and a TD against most third and fourth-stringers. As for Denver, Russell Wilson played again, but completed just 3 of 6 for 24 yards and rushed for 25 yards in minimal action. RB Javonte Williams made his return since suffering a knee injury early last season. He rushed for 12 yards and caught four passes for 18 yards, which was as good sign.</p><p>Las Vegas (-4.5/40) over LA Rams 34-17</p><p>Jimmy Garoppolo made his preseason debut for the Raiders against a team that usually doesn&rsquo;t care about preseason. He played in one series and completed all four of his attempts, leading them to a TD. The Rams continue to struggle on defense without Aaron Donald and rookie outside linebacker Byron Young. The Raiders amassed 440 yards of offense with Aidan O&rsquo;Connell and Brian Hoyer combining for 307 passing yards. Rookie Stetson Bennett competed 15 of 24 for 42 yards and a pick for the Rams. He didn&rsquo;t play quite as well as the previous week, but should end up as the backup to Matthew Stafford in the regular season.</p><p>SEATTLE (-6.5/40) over Dallas 22-14</p><p>Dallas hasn&rsquo;t cared about playing starters in preseason and it shows. They are struggling with some injuries at linebacker and the offensive line in terms of depth. Cooper Rush played the first half and threw a TD pass to Rice Dowdle. Will Grier completed 13 of 18 for 136 yards, but also threw a pick. Seattle played Geno Smith for the first time and he completed 5 of 6 passes for 46 yards. Drew Lock completed 5 of 6 for 119 yards and rookie WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba led the Seahawks with 3 catches for 58 yards. However, he suffered a fractured wrist and is uncertain for Week 1.</p><p>Sunday, August 20, 2023</p><p>New Orleans (-4) over LA CHARGERS 22-17</p><p>The Chargers are another team that rarely uses starters. The Saints took advantage led by Jameis Winston&rsquo;s 169 yards passing and no picks. New Orleans committed 14 penalties for 141 yards and they can&rsquo;t afford to bring that lack of discipline to the regular season. Easton Stick went all the way for the Chargers and completed 21 of 41 for 233 yards with two picks. Stick also rushed for 63 yards on seven carries.</p><p>Monday, August 21, 2023</p><p>WASHINGTON (+1.5) over Baltimore 29-28</p><p>The streak is over! Joey Slye kicked a 49-yard field goal with 10 seconds left to give Washington the win and halt a 24-game winning streak for the Ravens. Baltimore had not lost a preseason game since Sept. 3, 2015. Baltimore did not play poorly despite having a decimated group of corners and with Josh Johnson playing the entire first half at quarterback. Zay Flowers caught a 26-yard pass for a TD from Johnson on the first drive and sat the rest of the way. For Washington, Sam Howell played well, completing 19 of 25 for 188 yards with two TDs. He played the entire half as did WR Terry McLaurin, who sprained his toe late in the second quarter.</p>
