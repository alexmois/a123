                        <p>NFL Team Draft Needs</p><p>We're into April and that signifies one thing that matters in the sports world right now-the NFL Draft. The draft is scheduled to go from April 23-25. The first round will go off on Thursday at 8pmET, while rounds 2-3 will take place on Friday, April 24 at 7pmET. The draft will end on Saturday, April 25 with rounds 4-7.</p><p>The draft was originally supposed to be held in Las Vegas, but that is off due to the effects of COVID-19. That means NFL general managers will have to rely mainly on scouting from the college football season and the NFL Combine instead of working out players individually. But these are difficult times so teams will need to adjust to the circumstances. We'll take a look at the NFL Draft over the next couple of weeks, starting with the needs of each NFL team, adjusted through NFL free agency. Let's take a look at the AFC North, a division that should be much more competitive with Joe Burrow expected to go to Cincinnati and Ben Roethlisberger returning from injury to the Steelers.</p><p><h3><strong>AFC North</strong></h3></p><p><strong>Baltimore Ravens:</strong></p><p>2019: 14-2</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 15-2</p><p>First pick: 28</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: DE Calais Campbell (trade with Jacksonville). DL Derek Wolfe (Denver).</p><p>Key Losses: TE Hayden Hurst (trade-Atlanta), OG Marshall Yanda (retired), DT Chris Wormley (Steelers), DT Michael Pierce (Minnesota), LB Patrick Onwuasor (Jets).</p><p>Needs: ILB, Edge, WR, G, RB</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The Ravens are coming off their best regular season in team history, but they fizzled out in the playoffs against Tennessee. QB Lamar Jackson was the MVP, but also struggled along with his tight ends and receivers. Baltimore has had a busy off-season, adding Calais Campbell for a fifth-rounder, the huge defensive tackle from Jackson to help their defensive line. The Ravens needed the 6-8 veteran after they lost Michael Pierce in free agency and decided to trade DL Chris Wormley to Pittsburgh for a fifth-round pick. They also were expected to pick up DT Michael Brockers from the Rams, but they couldn't agree to a deal due to ankle issues and the fact that they couldn't give him a physical in today's climate. Instead of Brockers, they wound up signing veteran DT Derek Wolfe of Denver to a one-year deal.</p><p>Campbell will be a big help to the team's interior pass rush (6.5 sacks last year, 31.5 last 3 years). The pass rush is a big concern for the Ravens, who averaged 2.3 sacks per game (21st) and had to rely on the blitz too often. The Ravens also needed some help up front because they struggled against the run. That seems like an odd statement considering they allow just 93 yards per game (5th), but they gave up 4.4 yards per carry, their worst mark in the 24-year history of the team.</p><p>The Ravens also need help at inside linebacker (3/4 scheme) with Onwuasor gone to the Jets and Josh Bynes off to Cincinnati. This will certainly be addressed in the draft, maybe at 28, where they could look at LB Kenneth Murray from Oklahoma or Patrick Green from LSU.</p><p>On offense, the Ravens could really use a wide receiver to go along with Marquise Brown, the speedster from Oklahoma. He and slot receiver are basically their only consistent weapons. They traded third-string tight end Hayden Hurst to Atlanta for a second-round pick. With Mark Andrews and Nick Boyle, they could use another receiving tight end with some blocking skills. They could find that player in the middle rounds. Considering Mark Ingram is 30 and will turn 31 in late December, they could use a running back with receiving skills, who can block. With Jackson's running ability, the receivers, tight ends and running backs have to be able to be competent blockers.</p><p>Finally, speaking of blocking, the biggest hole for Baltimore will be at right guard, where All-Pro guard Marshall Yanda retired. They could go in-house here, but more likely they will draft several offensive linemen, considering they have a first, two seconds, two thirds and two fourth-round picks.</p><p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals:</strong></p><p>2019: 2-14</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 100-1</p><p>First pick: No. 1</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: ILB Josh Bynes (Baltimore), CB Mackensie Alexander (Vikings), S Vonn Bell (Saints), DE D.J. Reader (Texans), CB Trae Waynes (Vikings).</p><p>Key Losses: TE Tyler Eifert (Jags), OG John Miller (Panthers), DT Andrew Billings (Browns), OT Cordy Glenn, CB Dre Kirkpatrick, CB Darqueze Dennard.</p><p>Needs: QB, Edge, LB, G, WR, OT</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The key to this off-season was finishing with the worst record in the NFL. That allows them to take Joe Burrow (LSU) with the first pick to solve their quarterback issues. Though Andy Dalton is still technically on the team. He was not good last season, producing a 78.3-passer rating, while then-rookie Ryan Finley started for three games and didn't show much. So Burrow will likely step in and start from Day 1 and he'll have A.J. Green (if he's healthy), Tyler Boyd, and John Ross at receiver. They can use another receiver and tight end, now that Eifert is gone and Green has rarely played due to injuries over the last two seasons.</p><p>The Bengals struggled at cornerback due to injuries and are now going with Minnesota starters Alexander and Waynes. Both should help, especially Waynes, who is a solid player who had 58 tackles, a pick and two forced fumbles last season. They also brought in safety Vonn Bell, who had 89 tackles and two forced fumbles in 13 starts for the Saints last season. This is a team that allowed 394 yards per game (29th) and 149 rushing yards per game (32nd), so stopping the run is key, but they also struggled against the pass (245ypg, 21st).</p><p>The offensive line also needs work. Fortunately, G Jonah Williams, last year's top pick, will anchor the line after missing last season due to a shoulder injury. They are expected to lose left tackle Cordy Glenn, so finding one in the draft is crucial since they haven't picked up one yet in free agency.</p><p>If Burrow is the real deal, the Bengals should move closer to .500 this season. They haven't had a winning record since 2015, when they went 12-4 and have won 21 games over their last four seasons. Having a competent quarterback should also help Joe Mixon, who rushed for 1,137 yards last season.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></p><p>2019: 6-10</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 33-1</p><p>First pick: No. 10</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: TE Austin Hooper (Atlanta), DT Andrew Billings (Cincinnati), CB Kevin Johnson (Buffalo), OT Jack Conklin (Titans), DE Adrian Clayborn (Atlanta), QB Case Keenum (Washington), S Andrew Sendejo (Vikings).</p><p>Key Losses: TE Demetrius Harris (Bears), LB Christian Kirksey (Packers), LB Joe Schobert (Jaguars), S Eric Murray (Texans).</p><p>Needs: OT, LB, S, G</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The best move the Browns made all off-season was to fire coach Freddie Kitchens. Cleveland was one of the most undisciplined teams in football and some of that is a reflection of an inexperienced head coach. New coach Kevin Stefanski, formerly OC with Minnesota, takes over a talented team. But expectations won't be as high as they were last season. Everything revolves around Baker Mayfield, who struggled in his second season with 3,827 passing yards and 22 TDs, but also had 21 picks. They have Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry and Nick Chubb (1,494 yards), so the weapons are there. They also added Austin Hooper, who caught 74 passes for 787 yards with six TDs for Atlanta last season. What they need to do is build a stronger offensive line.</p><p>The Browns did add Jake Conklin from Tennessee, who started all 16 games. He'll start right away at right tackle. But they'll have to address the left tackle position in the draft. Greg Robinson is not the answer and you need somebody who is more athletic. Most likely, they'll be drafting a tackle at 10. Jedrick Willis from Alabama, Mekhi Becton from Louisville and Andrew Thomas from Georgia could be options. They also need help at guard and that will be addressed at running back.</p><p>Defensively, the Browns were often put in bad position thanks to Mayfield's turnovers. However, they have to get better against the run. They ranked 30th, allowing 144.7 yards per game and seventh against the pass (217ypg). So improving their front seven is key. They added DE Adrian Clayborn from Atlanta to help with the defensive line rotation. He's been a reserve for Atlanta with a high of 9.5 sacks in 2017. Andrew Billings (6-1, 328) is a big body, but he's coming from another team that struggled against the run-Cincinnati.</p><p>They added veteran corner Kevin Johnson from Buffalo, who at best, is a nickel corner. The safety play was poor last season and former Vikings and Eagles safety Andrew Sendejo could help some, but he's 32 and hasn't played a full season since 2014.</p><p>Cleveland could live up to more realistic expectations this year and compete for a wild card spot (especially with the new playoff rules) if Mayfield returns to his rookie form.</p><p><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers</strong></p><p>2019: 8-8</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 25-1</p><p>First pick: No. 49</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: TE Eric Ebron (Colts), DL Chris Wormley (Trade-Baltimore), OL Stefen Wisniewski (Chiefs).</p><p>Key Losses: CB Artie Burns (Bears), S Mark Barron, OL B.J. Finney (Seattle), DT Javon Hargrave (Eagles), TE Nick Vannett (Denver).</p><p>Needs: G, QB, OT, RB, Edge</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The fact that the Steelers could go .500 without Ben Roethlisberger for much of the season (hurt in Week 2) is pretty amazing. Mike Tomlin is a hell of a coach and he proved that last season. They went 8-8 with Mason Rudolph and "Duck" Hodges at quarterback. Rudolph threw for 1,765 yards and 13 TDs, but Hodges was more effective at leading the team, even though his numbers (1,063 yds, 5TDs, 8 INTs) were subpar. The bottom line is that they need Roethlisberger under center, yet at 38, the end is near. Rudolph doesn't appear to be the future and Hodges is a backup. Unfortunately for the Steelers, they don't have a first-round pick and won't make a selection until. Unless they trade up, they won't get a Burrow, Jordan Love, Justin Herbert or Tua Tagovailoa, so do they reach for a Jake Fromm, Jalen Hurts or Jacob Eason?</p><p>Pittsburgh is not known for its wild spending on free agents and this off-season is no different. They picked up Ebron from the Colts. He's an athletic tight end who has never really lived up to expectations, but should thrive as long as Big Ben is healthy. Last season, the Steelers' tight ends combined for just 408 yards to rank last in the league. A lesser concern is at receiver, where JuJu Smith-Schuster struggled as the number one option. Getting Roethlisberger back can only help his confidence.</p><p>This is still a team that will want to pound the ball on the ground to set up play-action. James Conner and Jaylen Samuels are not the long-term answer. They could use a back with a little more speed. They could take a chance at running back in the second round, and there should be several good options because teams don't value runners as much as other positions.</p><p>The main reason the Steelers stayed competitive was due to their defense. The allowed just 304.1 yards per game (5th) and 195 yards passing (3rd). The run defense needs a little work as they ranked 14th, allowing 109.5 yards per game. They could use some depth at linebacker and on the edge. Vance Williams is steady at one of the inside linebacker spots, but they could use more speed next to Devin Bush, who is a potential star.</p><p>If Roethlisberger can stay healthy, there's no doubt that Pittsburgh goes back to a 10-6/11-5 type of team because their defense is so good.</p>
