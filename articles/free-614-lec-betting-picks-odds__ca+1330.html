                        <p><h3>LEC Picks 6/14</h3></p><p><em><strong>*All odds courtesy of Bovada*</strong></em></p><p>The first weekend of the LEC Summer Split wraps up today, and we have another exciting five game slate in front of us. The biggest surprise thus far has been SK Gaming. They finished the Spring Split in 9th with a 4-14 record, but they've won their first two games in the Summer Split. The other big stroyline is that the defending Spring Split champions G2 Esports doesn't look nearly as dominant. Will SK Gaming continue to shock the LEC, and can G2 Esports find their groove in this last slate before a four day break?</p><p><h3>MAD Lions (-260) vs. SK Gaming (+185)</h3></p><p><strong>Kill Spread: MAD Lions -5.5</strong></p><p><strong>Kill Total: 26.5</strong></p><p>We will receive an answer to the question of SK Gaming early as they will open the day against a tough opponent in MAD Lions. The second match of the split was much kinder to MAD Lions. They dominated Excel in every fashion with 20 kills to only four deaths while taking down eight towers and only losing three. This was the rebound they needed after being wrecked by G2 Esports in their opener. SK Gaming continued to turn heads with their win over FC Schalke 04 to move to 2-0. This victory was much more decisive with 11 kills to only one death. They also took down nine towers while not losing one. A win over Excel isn't enough to convince me that MAD Lions has figured things out. Meanwhile, SK Gaming is playing at the top of their game this split and I'm going to ride the hot hand until they cool off.</p><p><h4>Pick: SK Gaming ML (+185)</h4></p><p><h3>Rogue (-260) vs. FC Schalke 04 (+185)</h3></p><p><strong>Kill Spread: Rogue -7.5</strong></p><p><strong>Kill Total: 22.5</strong></p><p>The second contest on this slate isn't quite as close in terms of talent in my eyes. Rogue rolled through both of their first two opponents on the way to their 2-0 record. They've averaged 12.5 kills to only one death in these two contests while dropping nine towers in their first game before downing 11 in their second. Their opponent, FC Schalke 04, has been the polar opposite of Rogue. They've lost both matches and have only averaged two kills to ten deaths, and they've only been able to take down 1.5 towers. This contest has the makings to be a bloodbath for Rogue, and I fully expect this to be the case. FC Schalke 04 will continue to be a cellar-dweller in the LEC while Rogue appears to have made the leap to the next level during the break in between splits.</p><p><h4>Pick: Rogue Spread -7.5 Kills (-105)</h4></p><p><h3>Origen (-200) vs. Misfits Gaming (+145)</h3></p><p><strong>Kill Spread: Origen -5.5</strong></p><p><strong>Kill Total: 23.5</strong></p><p>I don't quite know what to make of this contest here. Origen let their opener against SK Gaming slip away due to poor lane control, but they looked much better the second time around with a convincing win over the defending Spring Split champion G2 Esports. We can't exactly write Misfits Gaming out of this battle either because their first two matches were against Fnatic and Rogue, both of which appear to be top teams this split. They were able to give Fnatic a run for their money, but Rogue had their way with them in their second contest. This is going to be the match in which we see what Misfits Gaming is really made of. I'm going to make this play for only a unit, but I'm on Origen to cover the kill spread with another convincing win.</p><p><h4>Pick: Origen Spread -5.5 Kills (+100)</h4></p><p><h3>G2 Esports (-750) vs. Team Vitality (+425)</h3></p><p><strong>Kill Spread: G2 Esports -8.5</strong></p><p><strong>Kill Total: 28.5</strong></p><p>The moneyline on this battle are stout, but I believe this is with reason. G2 Esports is the defending Spring Split champion, and their loss to Origen can be held with a grain of salt as Origen will be a championship contender. Team Vitality took down FC Schalke 04 in their opener, but I think this speaks more to how bad FC Schalke 04 is than how good Team Vitality is. They were brought back down to earth in their second game against Fnatic, and I have a hard time believing that a team that was 2-16 in the spring will be much of a contender in this split either. I am all over G2 Esports to bounce back from their loss to Origen with a convincing win over Team Vitality, a team of which I believe will return to the cellar once again during this split.</p><p><h4>Pick: G2 Esports Spread -8.5 Kills (-115)</h4></p><p><h3>Fnatic (-650) vs. Excel (+375)</h3></p><p><strong>Kill Spread: Fnatic -8.5</strong></p><p><strong>Kill Total: 26.5</strong></p><p>I don't want to jinx Fnatic or anything, but there is a reason they are laying this much juice. Fnatic appears to be one of the teams to beat for the Summer Split while Excel has looked horrible. To put some of this into perspective, Fnatic's team has an average kill to death ratio of 1.45 over the last two games while Excel has a horrendous 0.14 kill to death ratio. Like many of the earlier matches in today's slate, we will see exactly where Excel is as a team in this bout. EIght and a half kills is a hefty spread, but I have a very hard time convincing myself that Excel can hang in this battle. Give me the clear-cut better team in this contest in Fnatic to dominate Excel in this bout.</p><p><h4>Pick: Fnatic Spread -8.5 Kills (-125)</h4></p>
