                        <p>We're in late July and that means the start of the NFL is right around the corner. Training camps are getting ready to start and each team has a question or several heading into camp. Without preseason, camps and practices will be more important considering players are going to need to get used to hitting.</p><p>Let's start with the NFC</p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p>Training Camp: State Farm Stadium (Glendale, Ariz.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can rookie linebacker Isaiah Simmons help turn that defense around?</em></p><p>The Cardinals should be a strong offensive team with the expected improvement of Kyler Murray and the addition of new receiver DeAndre Hopkins. The defense ranked last in the league in yards allowed per game (402ypg) and total receptions allowed (421). The additions of DT Jordan Phillips and linebackers D'Vondre Campbell and Devon Kennardy should help. But the big issue is where DC Vance Joseph will play rookie Isaiah Simmons on defense. Simmons is a linebacker who can play safety and even corner. But is he just a jack-of-all-trades or a really fast linebacker?</p><p><strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p>Training camp: Atlanta Falcons Training Facility (Flowery Branch, Georgia)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Todd Gurley return to his Pro Bowl form?</em></p><p>Gurley is just 25 and was one of the best running backs in the NFL at one point. Injuries have curtailed his production and the Rams gave up him. He comes to Atlanta with a chip on his shoulder and to a team that desperately needs a productive runner to take pressure off of Matt Ryan, who does continue to put up big numbers year-after-year.</p><p><strong>Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p>Training camp: Bank of America Stadium (Charlotte, N.C.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Matt Rhule help turn around the defense?</em></p><p>Teddy Bridgewater takes over for Cam Newton and should be a solid addition, assuming he can stay healthy. That's the big question with Bridgewater, who can take some pressure off of star RB Christian McCaffrey. But the real question is the defense. They were atrocious last season and top LB Luke Kuechly decided to retire. Rhule will bring in a 4-3 scheme lean on rookie DT Derrick Brown, but will need more from a secondary that was awful last season. They spent most of the draft on defense, so expect to see a lot of youngsters getting playing time right away, including S Jeremy Chinn. Camp will be extremely important considering they had no mini-camps or OTAs to help the rookies.</p><p><strong>Chicago Bears</strong></p><p>Training camp: Halas Hall (Lake Forest, Ill.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Will Nick Foles start the season at quarterback or will Matt Nagy stick with Mitch Trubisky?</em></p><p>It's always about the quarterback with the Bears. Trubisky finished near the bottom in most of the categories for quarterback. Foles was injured in Jacksonville, though he struggled before that. Nagy did coach Foles in Philadelphia and Kansas City. He also worked with OC Bill Lazor and quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo in the past, which gives him a slight edge over Trubisky. If Foles can become a competent quarterback and stay healthy, Nagy will still have a jobe in 2021. If not?</p><p><strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong></p><p>Training camp: Ford Center at The Star (Frisco, Tx.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Mike McCarthy make the difference in the Cowboys advancing in the playoffs?</em></p><p>McCarthey went to the playoffs in nine of 13 times with Green Bay and made it to the conference title four times. That's a lot more than Jason Garrett did, so Dallas is making an upgrade in the coaching staff. Nobody doubts the potential on offense, though there is a question at center with Travis Frederick retiring and Jason Witten moving on to the Raiders. Defensively, Mike Nolan takes over a group that has talent, but underachieved last season. Replacing Byron Jones at cornerback is paramount, but relying on rookies will be difficult.</p><p><strong>Detroit Lions</strong></p><p>Training camp: Detroit Lions Training Facility (Allen Park, Michigan)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Does Matt Patricia survive the season?</em></p><p>Coming off a 3-12-1 season and 9-22-1 overall, you have to wonder why Patricia is still coaching. Part of that is due to Matthew Stafford missing about half the season last year due to a broken back. The Lions drafted D'Andre Swift and he could be special at running back. WR Kenny Golladay is a star and Marvin Jones is a solid veteran. Stafford certainly has the weapons and the defense should be improved with all the New England castoffs. If Patricia can't get the Lions to close to 8-8, he's gone.</p><p><strong>Green Bay Packers</strong></p><p>Training camp: Don Hutson Center (Ashwaubenon, Wisc.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can the Packers stop the run when it matters?</em></p><p>The Packers had a great regular season, but they ran into San Francisco and allowed 285 rushing yards in a 37-20 loss to the Niners in the NFC Championship Game. The run defense has to improve, after allowing 120.1 yards per game. They didn't really address defense until late in the draft and for some reason picked a quarterback and running backs in their first two picks. Of course, everybody wants to know Aaron Rodgers' feeling about Jordan Love, but does Rodgers like anybody? He won't be angry with Love as he is with the team.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Rams</strong></p><p>Training camp: California Lutheran University (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Who will replace Todd Gurley at running back?</em></p><p>The Rams are coming off a disappointing season and Sean McVay went from best young coach ever to coach with the nicest house. He'll have some options to replace Gurley at running back. It starts with rookie Cam Akers, who played at Florida State. Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson Jr. are also options, though none of them are Gurley in their prime. Brendan Staley takes over at defensive coordinator after a coaching staff shakeup. That's a bit of a panic move considering the Rams made the Super Bowl two seasons ago.</p><p><strong>Minnesota Vikings</strong></p><p>Training camp: TCO Performance Center (Eagan, Minn.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Who will replace Stefon Diggs in the lineup?</em></p><p>The biggest question could have been Dalvin Cook's holdout, but he showed up on Tuesday. Diggs was a valuable receiver, who caught 63 passes for 1,135 yards with 13 TDs last season. The Vikes have a bunch of options, but the obvious one appears to be rookie Justin Jefferson from LSU. Defensively, there are questions in the secondary as they have to replace Xavier Rhodes and they were torched on the back end. Adam Zimmer (Mike's son) and Andre Patterson take over as co-coordinators. They better improve the defense, because Mike Zimmer will take a lot of grief for hiring his son if it doesn't work.</p><p><strong>New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p>Training camp: New Orleans Saints Training Facility (Metairie, La.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Drew Brees lead the Saints to the Super Bowl?</em></p><p>Brees signed a two-year deal in the off-season, but nothing is concrete in football. Brees has maybe a year or two left, but he's still one of the most accurate quarterbacks ever. He just needs to be on the same page with his teammates after a tumultuous off-season due to comments he made in June about the national anthem that brought some criticism from his teammates. Another key will be the defense and how key players will be returning from injuries including DL Marcus Davenport, LB Kiko Alonso, Alex Andazlone and DL Sheldon Rankins.</p><p><strong>New York Giants</strong></p><p>Training camp: Quest Diagnostics Training Center (East Rutherford, NJ)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Is Daniel Jones ready to take a bit step in Year 2?</em></p><p>Jones showed some promise as a rookie, but he has to limit the turnovers. Jones had 18 fumbles (11 lost) and 12 interceptions in 13 games. That has to improve with a new coordinator in Jason Garrett and coach in Joe Judge, who was a special teams coach in New England. Jones is just 38 and will be tested in a tough division. The biggest question on offense is whether the offensive line can protect Jones and open up holes for star RB Saquon Barkley. The Giants have a lot of questions on defense, but they spent just about every draft pick on that side of the ball.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles</strong></p><p>Training camp: NovaCare Complex (Philadelphia)</p><p><strong>Biggest question: How will the Eagles use Jalen Hurts?</strong></p><p>Everybody wonders why the Packers drafted Jordan Love in the first round, but the next biggest question of the draft was the Eagles taking Jalen Hurts in the second round. Hurts is an outstanding athlete at quarterback, who improved his passing at Oklahoma. Carson Wentz is just 27, but has had several injury issues. Wentz played every game this season, but was knocked out of the playoffs against Seattle with a concussion. Hurts can be an insurance policy, but Doug Pederson will find a way to use him in some formations. Another question will be at wide receiver, which was a disaster last season. Rookie Jalen Reagor will be asked to step in right away.</p><p><strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p>Training camp: San Francisco 49ers Training Facility (Santa Clara, Calif.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Will Deebo Samuel be ready for the season?</em></p><p>The 49ers had a pretty quiet off-season after losing in the Super Bowl last season to Kansas City. There's always talk of a Super Bowl hangover, even for the losing team. But GM John Lynch is more concerned about wide receiver Deebo Samuel, who broke his foot working out in June. Samuel was placed on the PUP list and is expected to miss a few games as a result of the injury. The Niners are a run-first team, but they have very little experience at receiver with Samuel out. They also could have an issue at left tackle with Joe Staley retiring and Trent Williams coming in. Williams might not miss a beat, but he missed last season (sat out) at Washington and had no mini-camps. He's an elite offensive tackle when healthy.</p><p><strong>Seattle Seahawks</strong></p><p>Training camp: Virginia Mason Athletic Center (Renton, Wash.)</p><p><strong>Biggest question: Where will the Seahawks get a pass rush?</strong></p><p>It's been an interesting offseason for Seattle, who traded two first-round picks to add Jamal Adams. He'll be their best strong safety since Kam Chancellor. But with Jadeveon Clowney not expected to return, the biggest question will be finding a pass rush. Clowney wasn't very productive (three sacks), but he was double-teamed almost every down and was able to generate pressure. Bruce Irvin and Benson Mayowa are not Clowney, but capable of combining for double-digit sack numbers. Last year's first-round pick L.J. Collier will have a chance to step up as a pass rusher.</p><p><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></p><p>Training camp: One Buccaneer Place (Tampa, Fla.)</p><p>Biggest question: How long will it take Tom Brady to get adjusted to his new receivers?</p><p>Brady isn't what he once was and will love having Mike Evans and Chris Godwin to throw the ball to. But he also needs time to adjust and will have no preseason games, so training camp will be huge for Brady and his receivers. It's also important that the offensive line steps up, considering Brady has no mobility. Defensively, the young secondary was torched last season. But they have a ton of talent. That said, they have to step up and improve their 30th-ranked pass defense from last season.</p><p><strong>Washington Football Team</strong></p><p>Training camp: Bon Secours Washington Football Team Training Center (Richmond, Va.)</p><p><em>Biggest question: Can Ron Rivera find a quarterback that can lead the WFT?</em></p><p>Yes, they are the Washington Football Team now. The biggest question isn't just when they come up with a nickname. It's a question that comes up almost every training camp in Washington. That's finding a competent quarterback. Second-year quarterback Dwayne Haskins has a big arm and just a little experience. The problem is, even with a new coaching staff, the lack of talent around him. Kyle Allen, who played for new coach Ron Rivera at Carolina, will compete with Haskins for the starting job.</p><p><em>(some info gleaned from CBSsports.com and NBC sports)</em></p>
