                        <p>NFL Team Draft Needs</p><p>We're into April and that signifies one thing that matters in the sports world right now-the NFL Draft. The draft is scheduled to go from April 23-25. The first round will go off on Thursday at 8pmET, while rounds 2-3 will take place on Friday, April 24 at 7pmET. The draft will end on Saturday, April 25 with rounds 4-7.</p><p>The draft was originally supposed to be held in Las Vegas, but that is off due to effects of COVID-19. That means NFL general managers will have to rely mainly on scouting from the college football season and the NFL Combine instead of working out players individually. But these are difficult times so teams will need to adjust to the circumstances. We'll take a look at the NFL Draft over the next couple of weeks, starting with the needs of each NFL team, adjusted through NFL free agency. Let's take a look at the AFC West, headed by the Super Bowl champ Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p><h3><strong>AFC South</strong></h3></p><p><strong>Denver Broncos:</strong></p><p>2019: 7-9</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 40-1</p><p>First pick: No. 15</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: DL Jurrell Casey (Trade Titans), OG Graham Glasgow (Lions), RB Melvin Gordon (Chargers), CB A.J. Bouye (Trade Jaguars)</p><p>Key Losses: CB Chris Harris Jr. (Chargers), C Connor McGovern (Jets), DE Derek Wolfe (Ravens),</p><p>Needs: WR, OT, CB, G, LB,</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The Broncos had a disappointing 2019 season, going 7-9. They acquired veteran QB Joe Flacco last off-season, but it's apparent that their present and future is Drew Lock. Now that they are building around a young quarterback, they need to give him a few more weapons. Fortunately, they are loaded at running back led by Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman and they have a big-time receiver in Courtland Sutton, who had 1,112 receiving yards last season.</p><p>Despite having two quality backs, Denver also added veteran RB Melvin Gordon from the Chargers. Gordon is just 27, but may be wearing down some. He is an excellent receiver, averaging around 45 catches in his five seasons, but has just one 1,000-yard rushing season. What they really need is a number two receiver since they dealt away Emmanuel Sanders last season to the 49ers. At 15, that's certainly a strong possibility as one of the top Alabama receivers could be there in Henry Ruggs or Jerry Jeudy or CeeDee Lamb from Oklahoma.</p><p>Another need is on the offensive line at tackle and guard. They did bring in Graham Glasgow from Detroit, who can play center or guard and has started in 58 games over his first four seasons. At left tackle, Garrett Bolles has 44 penalty flags in his first three seasons. Grabbing a tackle is another option and Andrew Thomas from Georgia could be there if Tampa Bay doesn't grab him one spot before at 14.</p><p>The Broncos lost veteran cornerback Chris Harris Jr. in free agency. That's after losing Bradley Roby last season. They do have some young talent led by Isaac Yiadom and Will Parks, but neither showed they could be quality starters in the long run. This is another big need though they did address that by trading for A.J. Bouye, a legitimate number one corner from the Jags for a fourth-rounder.</p><p>Despite having needs at corner and on the defensive line (they did trade for Jurrell Casey), the Broncos weren't bad statistically last season. They ranked 10th in points per game allowed (19.8), 11th in passing yards allowed (226) and 16th in rushing yards per game (16th). They struggled in forcing turnovers, as they were 25th in interceptions per game and 17th in sacks at 2.5 per game. Casey had 5.0 sacks for the Titans last season and is a strong pass rusher from the inside, accumulating 45.5 in his last seven seasons.</p><p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs:</strong></p><p>2019: 12-4</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 6-1</p><p>First pick: 32</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: CB Antonio Hamilton (NY Giants).</p><p>Key Losses: OG Stefen Wisniewski (Steelers), DE Emmanuel Ogbah (Dolphins), LB Reggie Ragland (Lions), CB Kendall Fuller (Redskins).</p><p>Needs: CB, RB, G, LB</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>There hasn't been a back-to-back Super Bowl champ since the Patriots did it in 2004 and 2005. Injuries are such an issue in football that it's become so tough to repeat. But Kansas City appears to be on the right track to repeat since they have few weakness and have the best quarterback in the game in Patrick Mahomes.</p><p>Defense is probably the biggest concern especially at cornerback with Kendall Fuller gone in free agency. Free agent Bashaud Breeland hasn't signed yet with any other team, so it's possible the Chiefs could re-sign him. The Chiefs added Anthony Hamilton from the Giants, but he has been a perennial backup in four seasons with New York and the Raiders.</p><p>The Chiefs improved their pass defense last season, allowing just 221.4 yards per game (8th) and finished 11th with 2.8 sacks per game. So the loss of Fuller and possibly Breeland could be devastating to their much-improved pass defense. They also have to improve the run defense, which ranked 26th against the run (128ypg). They lost LB Reggie Ragland to the Lions in free agency, but did put a franchise tag on DT Chris Jones.</p><p>Another issue for the Chiefs is covering running backs out of the backfield as the Chiefs ranked last in receiving yards to backs with 951. Finding an athletic middle linebacker at 32 is another option. Patrick Queen from LSU and Kenneth Murray from Oklahoma would fit that mold if they are around at the last pick in the first round.</p><p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders:</strong></p><p>2019: 7-9</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 50-1</p><p>First pick: No. 12, 19</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: WR Nelson Agholor (Eagles), DT Maliek Collins (Dallas), QB Marcus Mariota (Titans), DE Carl Nassib (Buccaneers), TE Jason Witten (Cowboys), SS Damarious Randall (Browns).</p><p>Key Losses: LB Tahir Whitehead (Panthers), S Karl Joseph (Browns).</p><p>Needs: WR, CB, S, IDL</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The biggest move for the Raiders was departing to Las Vegas. This is a franchise that has always been either in Northern California or Southern California and Mark Davis has moved to Vegas. That's a splashy town and while the Raiders made a lot of moves, their biggest pickup was a former top pick, who has failed to live up to expectations. That's Marcus Mariota, who signed a two-year, $17.6M deal to possibly be the backup quarterback to Derek Carr. That's what Mariota was at Tennessee late last year when Ryan Tannehill took over the reins and helped lead the team (managed the team) to the AFC Championship game. Mariota threw for seven TDs and two picks last year, but completed just 59.4% of his passes.</p><p>So what do the Raiders need? They weren't a bad team last year at 7-9 and have two first-round picks. It starts at wide receiver, where their top players combined for just 1,858 yards (29th in NFL). Tyrell Williams was inconsistent and Zay Jones has been disappointing. Fortunately for the Vegas Raiders, there is an abundance of quality receivers. If the spirit of Al Davis takes over Mike Mayock's body, he'll take Henry Ruggs III from Alabama. Ruggs rank a 4.27 40 and Davis loved receivers with blazing speed. They added Nelson Agholor in free agency, but he dropped about as many passes as he caught.</p><p>TE Jason Witten did catch 64 passes for 529 yards with Dallas last season, so while he's not going to outrun linebackers, he can at least get open and get first downs.</p><p>Defensively, the Raiders struggled against the pass last season, allowing 257 yards (25th) and recorded just 2.0 sacks per game (24th) with 0.6 interceptions (29th). In the final six games, they went 1-5 and recorded just seven sacks with three turnovers. They also ranked 31st in passer rating to opponents at 103.8 and led the league with pass interference penalties. So it's crucial that they get a cornerback and a safety in the draft. Xavier McKinney from Alabama is a quality free safety to play next to Johnathan Abram, though they did sign Damarious Randall from the Browns as a potential starter. Cornerback Jeff Gadney from TCU is another option, though he's just 5-10.</p><p>They also need some pass rushing help and who doesn't? Last year's fourth-round pick DE Maxx Crosby had 10 sacks as a rookie, so they did find a steal there. DE Carl Nassib comes over from The Titans and could rotate with Clelin Ferrell, last year's top pick, who is more of a run stopper. DT Maliek Collins (4.0 sacks) gives the Raiders a bit of an inside pass rusher. But bottom line is that the Raiders still have to consider beefing up that pass rush in the draft either at linebacker or defensive end.</p><p>Los Angeles Chargers</p><p>2019: 5-11</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 50-1</p><p>First pick: No. 6</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: OT Bryan Bulaga (JPackers), CB Chris Harris Jr. (Broncos), OG Trai Turner (Trade-Panthers,</p><p>Key Losses: QB Philip Rivers (Colts), RB Melvin Gordon (Chargers), FB Derek Watt (Steelers), WR Travis Benjamin (49ers), OT Russell Okung (Panthers), LB Jatavis Brown (Eagles), LB Thomas Davis (Redskins), S Adrian Phillips (Patriots), S Jaylen Watkins (Texans).</p><p>Needs: QB, CB, OT, G/C, WR</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>An era is now over. Philip Rivers is off to Indianapolis and after a subpar season, it felt time. However, now the Chargers need to find a quarterback to take over. At this point, it looks as though they'll go with backup Tyrod Taylor, who does have experience as a starter and has much more mobility. His last stint as a starter in Buffalo and he performed admirably, throwing for 51 touchdowns and just 16 interceptions. He does take care of the football and can run, but he'll be 31 when the season starts He's been a journeyman for a reason and his struggles in Cleveland (49.4% completion in four games) was his last short sample size of playing time. At 6, the Chargers may be able to take a chance on Tua Tagovailoa if he slips or take Justin Herbert from Oregon. Herbert makes some sense because he as all the physical attributes that Rivers had with more ability and a bigger arm. But he also would need a year to learn how to read defenses.</p><p>RB Melvin Gordon is also gone, but after a long holdout and a decline in production, this was no surprise. They will go with Austin Ekeler (557 yards) as the prime back, who also led the team with 92 catches for 993 yards and eight TDs. Grabbing another running back in the draft (not at six), would make some sense. Justin Jackson has shown flashes, but played in just seven games last year due to an ankle injury.</p><p>The Chargers also lost veteran left tackle Russell Okung in free agency. He struggled with injuries most of the season. Trent Scott and Sam Tevi played most of the season and allowed a combined 88 pressures to rank 31st in the league. Another option is Trey Pipkins, a third-rounder last season, who struggled in some action at left tackle. So drafting a tackle pretty high in the draft is going to be extremely important, even though Taylor is a lot more athletic than Rivers. He's also a lot smaller at 6-1, 215. Adding Bryan Bulaga should help at right tackle and he's still one of the best in the league, even at 31.</p><p>On defense, the Chargers ranked 5th against the pass but had just 1.9 sacks per game (29th). They added Chris Harris Jr. to their secondary that ranked last in completion rate to opponents at 71%. That's a big pickup in finding a veteran, who spent his entire career with the Broncos.</p><p>Up front, they picked up Linval Joseph, a 31-year old run-stuffer from the Vikings. With safety Derwin James back from a season-long injury, the Chargers should have one of the most improved defenses in the league. They just need to pick up a few pieces to continue to improve.</p>
