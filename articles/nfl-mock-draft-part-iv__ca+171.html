                        <p>NFL Mock Draft-The Final Edition</p><p>It's time for Ben's fourth and final Mock Draft with first and second rounds included. The NFL Draft starts on Thursday, April 23 with the first round and ends on Saturday. Will Tua Tagovailoa be drafted higher than Justin Herbert? What about Jerry Jeudy's most recent concerns about his knees? These are picks based on who I think these teams will pick, not including whether teams will trade the pick.</p><p>The draft will be shown on ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network.</p><p>Round 1</p><p><strong>1)Cincinnati Bengals - QB Joe Burrow, LSU, 6-3, 220.</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a no-brainer and probably the only 100% pick of the draft. Burrow threw for 60 touchdowns and just six picks. Very accurate thrower. If there is a concern, it's how he went from pretty good to Heisman winner in two seasons. Good coaching helps at the college level.</p><p><strong>2)Washington Redskins - DE/Edge Chase Young, Ohio State, 6-5, 264</strong></p><p>Comments: There's no doubt that Young is going second. The only question is whether Washington trades out of the pick and the Skins get a great deal. The best pass rusher in the draft by far, who should make an immediate impact. He recorded 16.5 sacks last season and might be the best player overall. If there is a concern, it's that he is a bit too upright against the run. But if you want the next Khalil Mack or Myles Garrett, you have to take the pick.</p><p><strong>3)Detroit Lions - CB Jeff Okudah, Ohio State, 6-1, 205.</strong></p><p>Comments: I'm stubborn. I know that the front office and Matt Patricia are not on the same page here according to reports. Will they go Okudah or DL Derrick Brown? I'll stick with Okudah. Detroit needs a top corner after trading away Darius Slay to the Eagles. Okudah is a big corner who moves like a smaller guy. Very athletic and compares to Jalen Ramsey. Good speed at 4.48 in the 40 and ball skills.</p><p><strong>4)New York Giants - OT Jedrick Wills, Alabama, 6-4, 314</strong></p><p>Comments: This should be a tackle either Wills or Wirfs. Wills has long arms to make up for his lack of prototypical height for a left tackle. Could play either side and is a mauler in the running game. He'll need time to develop into an elite pass protector.</p><p><strong>5)Miami Dolphins - QB Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama, 6-1, 217</strong></p><p>Comments: Uggh. What is Miami going to do. Trade up? Michael Lombardi reports that they want to move up to take a tackle? Huh? I'm still going with Tua here at No. 5 and that Miami is just experimenting. He's a big risk, but what else can the Dolphins do? Justin Herbert is a bigger risk. So is Jordan Love. Tua moves well, is accurate, and is a great deep ball thrower. Had 87 TDs and 11 picks in his career at Alabama with a 69.3% completing rate.</p><p><strong>6)LA Chargers - OT Tristan Wirfs, Iowa, 6-5, 320</strong></p><p>Comments: I think the Chargers try and move up to get Tua. If they can't, plan B would be to take an offensive tackle, who's really good. Good pass blocker. Played right tackle, but has athletic ability to play left tackle and even guard. Was dominant in college and showed well at the combine.</p><p><strong>7)Carolina Panthers - LB Isaiah Simmons, Clemson, 6-3, 238</strong></p><p>Comments: Looking for somebody to replace Luke Kuechly? Or can play Edge or some safety? Maybe that's the problem with Simmons. He'll slip down because teams don't know his position. That's his only weakness. He can play inside or out or even some safety. He ran an incredible 4.39 40 and is around 240 pounds. So he can play just about anywhere on defense. He's one of the few difference-makers in this draft.</p><p><strong>8)Arizona Cardinals - CB C.J. Henderson, Florida, 6-1, 204</strong></p><p>Comments: Big, athletic corner with great speed. Good technique. The Cards could certainly use a corner considering Patrick Peterson could be on the decline. Atlanta also could be trading up and would take Henderson.</p><p><strong>9)Jacksonville Jaguars - DL Derrick Brown, Auburn, 6-5, 326</strong></p><p>Comments: Might be a little bit late for Brown, but with teams trying to move up, he could be in danger of falling down. Also not a glamour position. Brown is the best defensive tackle in the draft. Was SEC Defensive Player of the Year and that's saying something considering there are so many great players at Alabama and LSU. Can play several positions on the line due to strength, size and explosiveness.</p><p><strong>10)Cleveland Browns - OT Andrew Thomas, Georgia, 6-5, 315</strong></p><p>Comments: It's time to be less flashy and more about substance. The Browns have enough skill position players, but they need an upgrade on the offensive line and somebody to protect Baker Mayfield. Thomas has good length and a football IQ. Another very good offensive tackle in a very strong group.</p><p><strong>11)New York Jets - WR CeeDee Lamb, Oklahoma, 6-1, 195</strong></p><p>Comments: Lamb is a vertical threat who is very explosive and is bit like a DeSean Jackson. Every time he touches the ball, he can score. But has decent size. Several teams would like to trade up to get him.</p><p><strong>12)Las Vegas Raiders - WR Henry Ruggs III, Alabama, 5-11, 188</strong></p><p>Comments: This pick is so Raiders. Al Davis would love this pick. Ruggs is a blur on the field and could be the next Tyreek Hill. Not as polished and will need some time to develop.</p><p><strong>13)San Francisco 49ers - WR Justin Jefferson, LSU, 6-1, 202</strong></p><p>Comments: Jefferson is an underrated receiver who can move the chains and become a solid number two next to Deebo Samuel on the Niners.</p><p><strong>14)Tampa Bay Buccaneers - OT Mekhi Becton, Louisville, 6-7, 369</strong></p><p>Comments: A monster who can protect Tom Brady and moves extremely well for his size. This is still a bit of a risk with his most recent red flag for a<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2020/04/browns-lt-prospect-mekhi-bectons-flagged-drug-test-shouldnt-hurt-draft-stock-much-multiple-nfl-sources-say.html"> test</a> issue. Will need to get weight down to go up against some of the best Edge rushers in the game.</p><p><strong>15)Denver Broncos --WR Jerry Jeudy, Alabama, 6-1, 193</strong></p><p>Comments: A knee issue is a concern, but I don't see the Broncos passing him up. Jeudy might not have the great intangibles in terms of size and speed, but nobody runs better routes and nobody is smoother. He might not have the greatest upside, but he will be good off the bat.</p><p><strong>16)Atlanta Falcons - DT Javon Kinlaw, South Carolina, 6-5, 324</strong></p><p>Comments: The Falcons need some pass rush help and some defense line additions. Kinlaw had six sacks last year and is not just a big dude. He's an athlete who can get to the quarterback from the inside. His upside is incredible because he is still raw.</p><p><strong>17)Dallas Cowboys - S/CB Xavier McKinney, Alabama, 6-1, 205</strong></p><p>Comments: McKinney can play free safety and can cover as a corner. The Cowboys have several holes in the secondary with Byron Jones leaving. McKinney can fill in at corner or safety.</p><p><strong>18)Miami Dolphins - CB A.J. Terrell, Clemson, 6-1, 190</strong>.</p><p>Comments: Elite corner who would have gone higher but struggled against LSU in the big game. Very long and lanky. Would be tough to pass up.</p><p><strong>19)Vegas Raiders - CB Kristian Fulton, LSU, 6-0, 197</strong></p><p>Comments: Raiders desperately need some help at corner. Fulton has enough size and speed to become a No. 1. Very fluid with good size. Not bad in run support.</p><p><strong>20)Jacksonville -LB Kenneth Murray, Oklahoma, 6-2 243</strong></p><p>Comments: This pick almost makes too much sense. He's too good to pass up. Murray is one of the premier inside linebackers in the draft and guys who don't put up huge sack numbers, usually don't drafted very high. He has the size and speed to become a starter from Day 1.</p><p><strong>21)Philadelphia Eagles - Edge K'Lavon Chaisson, LSU, 6-3, 254</strong></p><p>Comments: Philly is desperate for a receiver who can catch the ball. They will attempt to trade up to get Lamb, Jeudy or Jefferson. If they can't trade the pick, they could gamble or reach on a receiver. But Chaisson makes sense as he had 6.5 sacks so he still needs to refine his pass rushing moves. He has a great burst and could add more size. Tremendous upside.</p><p><strong>22)Minnesota Vikings - CB Trevon Diggs, Alabama, 6-1, 205</strong></p><p>Comments: Wouldn't this be the perfect pick? The Vikes get the young brother of Stefon Diggs. Diggs is a big corner who blossomed in his senior season to replace Xavier Rhodes. Also the younger brother of Stefon Diggs, so he has great genes.</p><p><strong>23)New England Patriots - OLB/DE Yetur Gross-Matos, Penn State, 6-5, 266</strong></p><p>Comments: Considered Jordan Love here, but Bill Belichick still loves defense and might want to see what he has in Jarrett Stidham before taking another young quarterback. Sturdy Edge rusher who is very explosive. Had 9.5 sacks last year. Long athlete who needs to keep getting better.</p><p><strong>24)New Orleans Saints - - QB Justin Herbert, Oregon, 6-6, 236</strong></p><p>Comments: Is Taysom Hill the future? Herbert has good size and arm strength. His ability to reach an NFL defense is a concern. He doesn't have to start right away with Brees playing at least one more year.</p><p><strong>25)Minnesota Vikings - Edge A.J. Epenesa, Iowa, 6-5, 274</strong></p><p>Comments: Another big pass rusher who is very powerful against the run and can rush the passer. Very good value pick. Had 11.5 sacks last year and 26.5 sacks at Iowa.</p><p><strong>26)Miami Dolphins -WR Denzel Mims, Baylor, 6-3, 205</strong></p><p>Comments: Big receiver. Could be a very good vertical threat but needs to be more consistent.</p><p><strong>27)Seattle Seahawks - DL Raekwon Davis, Alabama, 6-6, 315</strong></p><p>Comments: The Seahawks need help up front on the D-Line. Davis has a massive frame and is very active. He's a first-round talent coming off a second-round season.</p><p>28)Baltimore Ravens - ILB Patrick Queen, LSU, 6-1, 230</p><p>Comments: Just too good to pass up for the Ravens, who desperately need an inside linebacker. The only question is his size and whether that will hurt him in the running game.</p><p><strong>29)Tennessee Titans -OT Josh Jones, Houston, 6-6, 310</strong></p><p>Comments: Jones is too good to pass up at this pick. Long and consistent four-year starter. Will need to get stronger.</p><p><strong>30)Green Bay Packers - WR Jalen Reagor, TCU, 5-11, 190</strong></p><p>Comments: The Packers always seem to need a receiver and this guy is very fast. At least was at his pro day. Very dangerous receiver with good explosion and sturdily built. Could play slot as well.</p><p><strong>31)San Francisco 49ers - IOL Cesar Ruiz, Michigan, 6-4, 320</strong></p><p>Comments: A need pick here and a good value this late. One of the best guards in the draft. Plays with good leverage and can play right tackle as well.</p><p><strong>32)Kansas City Chiefs - RB De'Andre Swift, Georgia, 5-8, 210</strong></p><p>Comments: This is not the Chiefs' biggest need, but They could and should go for defense. but they can't pass up Swift here. So what if they don't have a great defense, assuming they'll score 30+ points per game.</p><p>2nd Round</p><p>33)Cincinnati Bengals-OLB Zack Baun, Wisconsin, 6-3, 240</p><p>34)Indianapolis Colts- DL Jordan Elliott, Missouri, 6-4, 320</p><p>35)Detroit Lions - DE Curtis Weaver, Boise State, 6-3, 266</p><p>36)NY Giants - CB A.J. Terrell, Clemson, 6-2, 190</p><p>37)LA Chargers - RB Jonathan Taylor, Wisconsin, 5-11, 215</p><p>38)Carolina Panthers - OT Ezra Cleveland, Boise State, 6-6, 315</p><p>39)Miami Dolphins - S Grant Delpit, LSU, 6-3, 203</p><p>40)Houston Texans - WR Tee Higgins, Clemson, 6-4, 215</p><p>41)Cleveland Browns - DT Ross Blacklock, TCU, 6-3, 290</p><p>42)Jacksonville Jaguars - WR Laviska Shenault, Colorado, 6-2, 220</p><p>43)Chicago Bears - CB Jaylor Johnson, Utah, 5-11 ,195</p><p>44)Indianapolis Colts - WR Chase Claypool, Notre Dame, 6-4, 230</p><p>45)Tampa Bay Buccaneers - QB Jacob Eason, Washington, 6-6, 225</p><p>46)Denver Broncos - S Jeremy Chinn, Southern Illinois, 6-2, 210</p><p>47)Atlanta Falcons - OT Prince Tega Wanogho, Auburn, 6-7, 310</p><p>48)NY Jets- CB Bryce Hall, Virginia, 6-0, 200</p><p>49)Pittsburgh Steelers - DT Neville Gallimore, 6-2, 330</p><p>50)Chicago Bears - TE Cole Kmet, Notre Dame, 6-6, 255</p><p>51)Dallas Cowboys - CB Cameron Dantzler, Mississippi State, 6-2, 175</p><p>52)LA Rams - OT Lucas Niang, TCU, 6-6, 330</p><p>53)Philadelphia Eagles - ILB Malik Harrison, Ohio State, 6-3, 245</p><p>54)Buffalo Bills - Edge Julian Okwara, Notre Dame, 6-4, 248</p><p>55)Baltimore Ravens - G Solomon Kindley, Georgia, 6-4, 335</p><p>56)Miami Dolphins - C Lloyd Cushenberry, LSU, 6-4, 315</p><p>57)LA Rams - OL John Simpson, Clemson, 6-4, 330</p><p>58)Minnesota Vikings - OT Isaiah Wilson, Georgia, 6-7, 340</p><p>59)Seattle Seahawks - S Kyle Dugger, Lenoir-Rhyme, 6-1, 215</p><p>60)Baltimore Ravens - RB J.K.
