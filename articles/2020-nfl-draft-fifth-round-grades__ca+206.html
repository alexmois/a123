                        <p><h4>Fifth Round</h4></p><p><strong>147)Cincinnati Bengals, Edge Khalid Kareem, Notre Dame. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Has good size and length at 6-4, 268. Probably a situational player. But has good motor and quickness. Would like to see more production at Notre Dame.</p><p><strong>148)Seattle Seahawks (from Washington through Carolina), DE Alton Robinson, Syracuse. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Just not a great draft for defensive ends. Robinson has all the tools and ran a fast 40 time. Decent size at 6-3, 264. Needs to get stronger against the run and doesn't do a good enough job getting off blocks.</p><p><strong>149)Indianapolis Colts, G Danny Pinter, Ball State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Pinterplayed tight end the first three seasons at Ball State and then started at right tackle. He does have good athletic ability and can pass block on the inside. Projected as a guard.</p><p><strong>150)New York Giants, G Shane Lemieux, Oregon. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: A solid four-year starter at 6-4, 310. Never missed a game. Solid run blocker. Good quickness and lower body strength. Quality pick here.</p><p><strong>151)LA Chargers, WR Joe Reed, Virginia. Grade:B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Reed is built like a running back at 6-1, 224. Can line up in the slot and at running back. Very dangerous return man. Another versatile guy who can cover kicks and has 17 tackles.</p><p><strong>152)Carolina Panthers, S Kenny Robinson, West Virginia. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like thinking out of the box. Played in the XFL. Had some academic issues at West Virginia. good player who is a ballhawk. A steal here if he can mature.</p><p><strong>153)San Francisco (from Miami), OT Colton McKivitz, West Virginia. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comment: This was the pick for <a href="https://dolphinswire.usatoday.com/2020/04/25/dolphins-trade-pick-no-153-for-49ers-rb-matt-breida/">RB Matt Breida</a>. Nice pick up for the 49ers. At 6-6, 306, could use a little more size. Is strong in the running game, but needs work as a pass protector. May end up at guard.</p><p><strong>154)Miami Dolphins (from Jax through Pittsburgh), DE Jason Strowbridge, North Carolina. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-4, 275, where does he play? Has short arms for defensive tackle. Not fast enough for an end. Good strength and did well at Senior Bowl. Solid run defender. May turn out as a run-stuffing defensive end and one or two-down player</p><p><strong>155)Chicago Bears, DE Trevis Gipson, Tulsa. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick here. Gipson can play end or outside linebacker at 6-3, 261. Has good length, size and speed. Needs to work on coming off his blocks. Has good inside moves at rushing the passer and disrupts as a run defender.</p><p><strong>156)Washington Redskins, C Keith Ismael, San Diego State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: A good pick for the Skins. Ismael is a sound pass blocker and has good toughness. Centers don't often go very high. Average size at 6-3, 309. Can also play some guard.</p><p><strong>157)Jacksonville Jaguars, S Daniel Thomas, Auburn. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Thomas is 5-10, 215, so built like a small linebacker More of a box safety who lacks great range. Good instincts in coverage. Tough against the run. Not a bad pick for Jags.</p><p><h5>158)NY Jets, CB Bryce Hall, Virginia. Grade: A-</h5></p><p>Comments: Didn't love them taking a quarterback in the fourth round, but Hall is a steal here. At 6-1, 202, has good size Good length and has the playing speed to develop into a starting corner. Has big hands as well, which would help in grabbing picks.</p><p><strong>159)New England Patriots, PK Justin Rohrwasser, Marshall. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Never liked taken a field goal kicker this high, unless he's Justin Tucker, who was undrafted. Maybe Pats thought he they had so many picks, it was worth a gamble. Pats needed a kicker with Stephen Gostkowski gone. Made 15 of his 20 field goal attempts and 39 of 41 extra points at Rhode Island. At Marshall, made 33 of his 42 field goal attempts and 79 of 72 extra points. Has a career long of 52.</p><p><strong>160)Cleveland Browns, C Nick Harris, Washington. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Solid pick with a first-team All-Pac 12 selection in his last two seasons. Harris is just 6-1, 302 but is very agile and tough. Undersized player who will play with a chip on his shoulder. Had 42 starts in four seasons.</p><p><strong>161)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, WR Tyler Johnson, Minnesota. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Decent size at 6-1, 206. Good route runner. Very good after the catch. Just doesn't have great speed. Had some drops and has small hands. Very productive receiver. Solid pick here if he can get open and catch the ball for TB12.</p><p><strong>162)Washington Redskins, OLB Khaleke Hudson, Michigan. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Undersized linebacker with short arms, but is very fast. Just 5-11, 224 and can stop the run. Most likely a special teams player with his speed.</p><p><strong>163)Chicago Bears, CB Kindle Vildor, Georgia Southern. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Just 5-10, but a solid 191 pounds. His good length makes up for lack of size. Also good ball skills and hands. Most likely a nickel back because he's not a burner on the field.</p><p><strong>164)Miami Dolphins, DE Curtis Weaver, Boise State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good pick here. Weaver was expected to go higher. He just gets things done, despite not having great speed or quickness. Needs to play with better pad level. Had 13.5 sacks last year and 34 in three years at Boise State.</p><p><strong>165)Jacksonville Jaguars, WR Collin Johnson, Texas. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Very tall receiver at 6-6, 222. So he's a huge target in the red zone. Not very fast, but can get vertical and can get yards after contact. Tough for very tall receivers to get open in the middle of the field, so he will need to work on his routes.</p><p><strong>166)Detroit Lions, WR Quintez Cephus, Wisconsin. Grade: C</strong>-</p><p>Comments: Productive receiver who is 6-1, 202. Very strong frame and good runner after the catch. Has small hands and not a consistent receiver. Will drop some. Will have to improve to make the team. Some legal issues as well in his past.</p><p><strong>167)Buffalo Bills, QB Jake Fromm, Georgia. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Fromm really fell down. Not great size at 6-2, 219 and lacks arm strength. Pretty good college quarterback who projects as a backup in the NFL. Bills don't need a starter, so adequate pick here. Smart player who manages the game well.</p><p><strong>168)Philadelphia Eagles (from NE), WR John Hightower, Boise State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: This was the Eagles' second receiver taken after Jalen Reagor. Hightower is 6-2, 189 and caught 51 passes for 943 yards with eight TDs. has the speed to get vertical. Needs to add some size.</p><p><strong>169)Minnesota Vikings, CB Harrison Hand, Temple. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Vikings are having a strong draft. Hand is not a start, but is a tough run defender at 5-11, 197. Physical player with decent speed and plays the ball well in zone.</p><p><strong>170)Baltimore Ravens, DT Broderick Washington, Texas Tech. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments. Ravens needed an Edge so this was disappointing. But they did need depth behind Brando Williams. He's just not as big as Williams or Michael Pierce (gone) at 6-2, 305. Won't command double teams.</p><p><strong>171)Houston Texans, WR Isaiah Coulter, Rhode Island. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Like taking FCS players here. Coulter is 6-2, 198 with good speed. He can use some weight and some work on his route running A developmental receiver that might contribute in a year or two.</p><p><strong>172)Detroit Lions, RB Jason Huntley, New Mexico State. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: The Lions got their runner in Swift, but they need some depth. Huntley is explosive at 5-8, 190. Rushed for over 1,000 yards last season and also caught 134 passes for 1,119 yards in his career.</p><p><strong>173)Chicago Bears, WR Darnell Mooney, Tulane. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: I've been waiting to say it's a meh pick. Mooney is 5-10, 176 so not only is he small, but he's light. Not great hands either. Will play the slot if he makes the team.</p><p><strong>174)Tennessee Titans, DT Larell Murchison, NC State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Good run defender at 6-3, 297. Had seven sacks, though 5.5 came against Florida State and Syracuse. He's light for a defensive tackle and not long enough for a 3-4 defensive end.</p><p><strong>175)Green Bay Packers, ILB Kamal Martin, Minnesota. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Martin has decent size at 6-3, 240 and is strong against the run. Also not bad in coverage, but would be better in zone than in man.</p><p><strong>176)Minnesota Vikings, WR K.J. Osborn, Miami-Fla. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Average size at 6-0, 203 and runs well after the catch. Also good blocker, but averaged just 10.9 yards per catch.</p><p><strong>177)Kansas City Chiefs, DE Mike Danna, Michigan. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not very big at 6-2, 251. Gives good effort at rushing the passer. Will need to get stronger to play the run. Really just a rotational guy at Michigan. Will have to make it on special teams.</p><p><em>(some info via ESPN.com)</em></p><p><strong>178)Denver Broncos, OLB Justin Strnad, Wake Forest. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not a misspelling. That's how you spell his last name. Has good height at 6-3, 238. Very rangy and gives good effort. But lacks elite speed. Good awareness.</p><p><strong>179)Dallas Cowboys, DE Badley Anae, Utah. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Another solid Utah player on defense. Anae is a team captain who gets the most out of his ability. Lacks size, has short arms and elite speed. But sometimes guys like Anae get by on effort and a motor.</p>
