                        <p>2023 NFL Preseason Recap for Week 1</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at last week&rsquo;s NFL preseason games with a betting angle. Which backup quarterbacks played well and how did the rookies quarterback fare?</p><p>Thursday, August 10</p><p>Houston (-3/37) over NEW ENGLAND 20-9</p><p>Rookie QB C.J. Stroud&rsquo;s first start was a mixed bag. He played just two series and went just 2-for-4 for 13 with a pick. He also took a sack. Davis Mills played well, completing 9-for-12 for 99 yards with a touchdown. Case Keenum (9 of 14 for 79 yds, 1 TD) also played decently, but he&rsquo;s not in the mix for the starting job. The Patriots started QB Bailey Zappe, who completed 12 of 14 for 79 yards. Rookie QB Malik Cunningham scored on a 9-yard run late in the game for the Patriots' lone TD. They accumulated just 166 yards of offense.</p><p>SEATTLE (-3.5/37.5) over Minnesota 24-13</p><p>Drew Lock started for the Seahawks and played into the fourth quarter. Lock completed 17 of 24 for 191 yards with two TDs and a pick. Seattle rookie WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba had three catches for 25 yards. Rookie Jordan Addison caught one pass for 22 yards for the Vikings. The Vikes used QB Nick Mullens, who completed 14 of 20 for 139 yards with one TD.</p><p>Friday, August 11</p><p>Green Bay (-4.5/36) over CINCINNATI 36-19</p><p>The Jordan Love era got start on the right foot. He threw for 70 yards and a TD in two series. He did overthrow Luke Musgrave to end the first series. Another big story was that rookie QB Sean Clifford led four scoring drives and went 20 of 26 for 208 yards wit a TD, but also had two picks, playing most of the game. The Bengals played most backups with QB Trevor Siemian going 15 of 28 for 121 yards with a pick in the second half. But Jake Browning got the start and played the entire first half. He completed 10 of 17 for 95 yards. One of those QBs might have to start during the regular season if Joe Burrow (calf) is not ready.</p><p>Atlanta (+2) over MIAMI 19-3</p><p>This was a defensive battle as Atlanta intercepted Miami&rsquo;s quarterback three times, recorded five sacks and had nine quarterback hits. Miami is looking for a backup to Tua Tagovailoa and is still looking. Mike Went completed 9 of 14 for 85 yards in the first half, but threw a pick in the end zone in the opening drive. Skylar Thompson completed 10 of 16 for 104 yards with two picks and a lost fumble. The Falcons didn&rsquo;t use anybody of significance. QB Logan Woodside played the entire game and completed 14 of 23 for 146 yards with no picks and no TDs</p><p>Pittsburgh (-3/39.5) over TAMPA BAY 27-17</p><p>Second-year QB Kenny Pickett got the job done in the first series leading the Steelers to a TD and left. He went 6-of-7 for 70 yards with a passing TD. Mason Rudolph went most of the way and went 7 of 12 for 132 yards and a TD. The TD was a 67-yard pass to second-year WR Calvin Austin. The Bucs have a quarterback competition and started Baker Mayfield who took care of the football. He completed 8 of 9 for 63 yards including a 10-yard TD pass to Trey Palmer. His competitor is Kyle Trask, who completed 6 of 10 for 99 yards with a pick. He gets a chance to start on Friday against the Jets.</p><p>DETROIT (+1/35.5) over NY Giants 21-16</p><p>The Giants led 13-3 at the half and then their backups allowed 18 points in the second half. That&rsquo;s always a tough beat in the preseason. Rookie wide receiver Jalin Hyatt had just one catch for minus-four yards on 16 snaps. With most starters out, all eyes were on the third-round burner. Rookie Tommy DeVito played most of the game and completed 15 of 24 for 155 yards with a TD and a pick. As for the Lions, they went with Nate Sudfeld for most of the game. He completed 15 of 28 for 194 yards, but also had two picks. One of his picks came on the first possession. Last year&rsquo;s No. 12 overall pick Jameson Williams caught two passes for 18 yards. He will miss the first six games due to a violating the NFL&rsquo;s gambling policy.</p><p>Washington (+2.5/36.5) over CLEVELAND 17-15</p><p>Washington QB Sam Howell played into the second quarter and completed 9 of 12 for 77 yards and one TD. The offensive line didn&rsquo;t give him much help early and it showed early. WR Jahan Dotson was impressive with two catches, including a 26-yard reception. Deshaun Watson get the start for the Browns. He completed all three of his passes for 12 yards and rushed for 20 yards on three attempts. Watson is expected to play in the final preseason game, but not this week. The Browns managed to produce 374 yards, but most points came in the second half when rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw a 7-yard pass to David Bell and Kellen Mond threw a 20-yard TD pass to Mike Harley Jr.</p><p>ARIZONA (+6/37.5) OVER Denver 18-17</p><p>This was a solid performance by Arizona&rsquo;s defense, who got a lot of pressure on Russell Wilson. He completed 7 of 13 for 93 yards and a TD. Backup Jarrett Stidham (5 of 15 with an INT) was just as bad as the reserve offensive line, who committed four penalties With Kyler Murray (knee) out in the recent future, the Cards were not going to play Colt McCoy (4 of 4 for 17 yds) too long. Rookie Clayton Tune showed some promise with 135 yards passing (13 of 23) with one TD and one pick.</p><p>Saturday, August 12</p><p>BUFFALO (+3.5/36.5) over Indianapolis</p><p>Rookie QB Anthony Richardson made his debut with the Colts before he was officially named the starter for the regular season. He went 7 of 12 for 67 yards and a pick in three series. Gardner Minshew is a strong backup and went 6-of-6 for 72 yards. Josh Allen sat for the Bills so the real story was S Damar Hamlin&rsquo;s return to the field. No. 2 CB Dane Jackson caught the interception from Richardson. Kaair Elam and Christian Benford are also competing for playing time at corner. Backup QB Matt Barkley was really good at 14 of 15 for 172 yards with two TDs, while Kyle Allen struggled, going 8 of 15 for 122 yards and a pick.</p><p>CHICAGO (-3.5/35.5) over Tennessee 23-17</p><p>The Bears outscored the Titans 9-0 in the second half to get the win and cover, after falling behind 17-14 at the half. The good news was the QB Justin Field led two back-to-back touchdown drives, including finding new top guy D.J. Moore for a short pass that he turned into a 62-yard touchdown. Fields also found Khalil Herbert for a dump-off pass and he took it 56 yards for a score. The Bears used four quarterbacks and they combined to complete 15 for 24 for 243 yards with one pick from P.J. Walker. As for the Titans, Malik Willis got the start and finished with 189 yards passing and a two-yard TD run. He also threw an interception. Rookie Will Levis completed 9 of 14 for 85 yards and a pick.</p><p>NY Jets (+3/35) over CAROLINA 27-0</p><p>This was an embarrassing home debut and new coach Frank Reich. Fortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t count and the Jets had their timing down after playing in the Hall of Fame game. Rookie Bryce Young completed 4 of 6 for 21 yards, but had very little time to throw against an offensive line that was dominated by the Jets&rsquo; defensive front. He was hit three of the seven times he dropped back. Matt Corral went 15 of 22 for 126 yards and a pick as the backup to Young. For the Jets, Zach Wilson had a strong game, going 14 of 20 for 123 yards and a score. He led the offense to a touchdown and two field goals in six series.</p><p>Jacksonville (-4/37.5) over DALLAS 28-23</p><p>Trevor Lawrence had mixed results in a surprise start. He threw a pick early in the first series and on the third series, he hit Christian Kirk on a fourth-down pass for a score. C.J. Beathard played the rest of the first half and Nathan Rourke came in later to throw for 153 yards and a TD. WR Calvin Ridley caught two passes for 21 yards in his debut as a Jaguar after missing last season with a gambling suspension. The Cowboys went with backups and that&rsquo;s why they lost. But they needed a backup to RB Tony Pollard with Zeke Elliott gone. Deuce Vaughn ran for 50 yards on eight carries and the 5-6 running back from Kansas State might be a new favorite Cowboy player.</p><p>Philadelphia (+6/35.5) covers over BALTIMORE 19-20</p><p>The Eagles covered this game late thanks to a 31-yard interception return from Eli Ricks and a missed two-point conversion. The Eagles started out strong as Marcus Mariota was solid going 7 of 11 for 58 yards. New RB D&rsquo;Andre Swift had a 22-yard run early to set the tone for the Eagles, who were up 13-10 at the half. Baltimore started Josh Johnson at QB (45 yards, 1 TD) and he probably lost the backup battle to Tyler Huntley (88 yds), who played in the second half. However, Huntley tweaked his hamstring and might miss the Ravens&rsquo; MNF game against Washington. Tylan Wallace caught a TD pass and that was big for the former fourth-round pick in 2021, who is trying to make the roster.</p><p>LA Chargers (+2.5/34) over LA RAMS 34-17</p><p>In a game where neither coach cares about the preseason, there were a lot of points scored in this one. Easton Stick and Max Duggan are battling it out for the backup job for the Chargers. Stick (14 for 21, 109 yds, 1 TD) started the first half and played well. Rookie WR Quentin Johnson struggled as he dropped two passes. For the Rams, rookie Stetson Bennett passed for 191 yards and one TD. Bennett, however, was helped by two dropped interceptions in his first series, but grew more comfortable after that. He appears to have a lock on the backup job over Brett Rypien, who played in the first three series and threw for just 11 yards.</p><p>Sunday, August 13</p><p>NEW ORLEANS (-1.5/38) over Kansas City 26-24</p><p>The Saints were up 17-7 at the half, but the Chiefs took the lead in the third quarter when they scored 14 points. The Chiefs could have issues with the pass rush as Charles Omenihu is suspended for the first six games. Patrick Mahomes played a little and completed 2 of 2 for 15 yards. Shane Buechele played most of the way as he completed 11 of 18 for 155 yards with two TDs and a pick. For the Saints, new QB Derek Carr was solid, going 6 for 8 for 70 yards and a TD. Backup Jameis Winston completed 11 of 13 for 92 yards and a TD with no picks. The big story was that WR Michael Thomas returned after having not played much the last two seasons and caught one pass for 16 yards.</p><p>LAS VEGAS (+4/37) over San Francisco 34-7</p><p>The Raiders just stomped the 49ers in this one. Now, if you look at numbers, Trey Lance must have played well (10 of 15, 112 yds, 1 TD) for the Niners. However, his passing touchdown should have been picked off in the end zone and somehow bounced to TE Ross Dwelley, who caught the ball for the TD. He also was sacked four times and could have had another pick that was dropped. Sam Darnold was 5 for 8 for 84 yards in the second half, but he will need to take the backup job. The Raiders didn&rsquo;t play former 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo and for good reason, considering his prior healthy issues. Rookie QB Aidan O&rsquo;Connell played well for three quarters, completing 15 of 18 for 141 yards and a TD pass with a 117.8 passer rating.</p>
