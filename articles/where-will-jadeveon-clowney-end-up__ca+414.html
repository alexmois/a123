                        <p>One of the top free agents this year is DE Jadeveon Clowney and we will take a look at some of his possible landing spots in this article. Clowney began his career in Houston as the number one overall pick in the 2014 draft. He played just four games that season but 58 games over the next four seasons for the Texans.</p><p>The three-time pro bowl defensive end racked up 61 tackles for loss, 67 quarterback hits, 29 sacks, and six fumble recoveries in his last four years with Houston. Last year, he moved on to Seattle and had three sacks along with seven tackles for loss, 13 QB hits, and two fumble recoveries for them. Bottom line is that Jadeveon Clowney is a stat sheet stuffer on the defensive side of the ball and he may be the most feared DEs in the league.</p><p>The deal he signed with the Seahawks was just for one year so now the question is, &ldquo;where will Clowney end up?&rdquo; He is coming off surgery form a sports hernia and has recently been cleared by his medical staff to resume playing. One spot that he could land is right back with the Seahawks, which is not out of the question as Clowney has stated he wants to play for a contender.</p><p>I see the Seahawks as a contender but there are other teams out there that clearly fit the bill. The Eagles have recently emerged as a team to watch out for as they are clearly a team that is interested in one of the best defensive ends in the league. Philadelphia may need to upgrade their defense after they failed to upgrade the offense in the draft. This is a team that may need to win with their defense this year and Clowney would be a beast on this team, especially paired with DE Yannick Ngakoue, who Philadelphia got from Jacksonville in a blockbuster trade. This defense could be downright scary if they get Clowney. We also note that the Eagles have 23.5 million dollars in cap space.</p><p>The Colts are another team that would be interested in him. They certainly know what he is capable of as Clowney has 4.5 sacks, six tackles for loss, and 13 QB hits in eight career games against them. The Colts already have a strong front seven that includes Darius Leonard and DeForest Buckner and the addition of Clowney would give them a shot at having the best defenses in the league. The Colts also have plenty of cap space to get him. Getting the former South Carolina star would make the Colts the unquestionable favorites to win the AFC South.</p><p>Another team to look at ar the Cleveland Browns. Should the Browns land him, he would pair with DE Myles Garrett, giving them the most dominant defensive line in the league. Are the brown contenders enough to get Clowney? This is a team that has been rebuilt from the ground up and the addition of Clowney would put them in the running in the AFC. There is a lot of upside with the Browns and Jadeveon would be a good fit for this team.</p><p>The Titans could also be in the mix. They have a strong running game and upgrading their defense would help improve their odds of taking the AFC South this year. Tennessee also needs to keep up with the Colts, who had a great offseason so far. They could not afford to let Clowney go to their division rivals or the AFC South would definitely go to the Colts.</p><p>The Giants and Dolphins are also in the mix, but neither are contenders this year and Clowney has announced that he wants to play for a contender. Still, both teams have the money to make him a nice offer and we all know that money talks. It would be interesting to see if he turns down more money from a non-contender to play for a team that might win it all. I will continue to follow this as an offer could be made to him very soon. <br /><br />Info Gleaned From <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBermanFox26/status/1257872206211801090">Fox's Mark Berman</a>, Along With <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jadeveon-clowney-free-agency-tracker-top-landing-spots-projected-contract-latest-updates-rumors-and-more/">CBS Sports</a> & <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2888698-jadeveon-clowneys-top-landing-spots-after-2020-nfl-draft">Bleacher Report</a></p>
