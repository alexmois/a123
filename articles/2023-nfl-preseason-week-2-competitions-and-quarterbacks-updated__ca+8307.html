                        <p>2023 NFL Preseason Week 2 Competitions and Quarterbacks (updated)</p><p>Who will play in Week 2 of the preseason? Many of the gameplans are out and some coaches won&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the best storylines for Week 2 in preseason along with projected starters at quarterbacks.</p><p>Friday, August 18, 2023</p><p>Carolina at. NY Giants</p><p>Bryce Young will get another look at quarterback for the Panthers. But if the offensive line doesn&rsquo;t give him enough time, then his stint will be short again. That means Matt Corral should get a lot of time. The good news is that the Giants are limited on the defensive line as several backups are injured including Leonard Williams.</p><p>The Giants played backup QB Tyrod Taylor for just two possessions last week, which is fine because they know what he&rsquo;s capable of. Rookie Tommy DeVito played most of the game and is likely to do the same again.</p><p>Cincinnati at Atlanta</p><p>The Bengals were bad on both sides of the ball last week in a 36-19 loss to Green Bay. Zac Taylor should stick to the gameplan and keep out most of his regulars. Joe Burrow (calf) is certainly not going to play. Jake Browning and Trevor Siemian will now battle it out for the backup job and this is crucial, considering the fact that Burrow could miss the opener. The rest of the starters should see playing time.</p><p>Falcons&rsquo; fans should get a chance to see explosive rookie RB Bijan Robinson this week. QB Desmond Ridder could also play after not playing in the first week. Ridder is one of the few starting quarterbacks who can use the time.</p><p>Saturday, August 19, 2023</p><p>Jacksonville at Detroit</p><p>The Jags started QB Trevor Lawrence last week and he played in three series throwing a pick and a TD. Most likely, C.J. Beathard gets the start for this one and Nathan Rouke cleans up for the Jags.</p><p>Understandably, Jared Goff did not play for Detroit in the opener. Rookie first-round pick Jahmyr Gibbs was impressive, led by a 19-yard catch and run. Nate Sudfeld is not a great backup option to Goff. Teddy Bridgewater is a better backup option and should play a series or two after just joining the team last week. The Lions and Dan Campbell could play the starters a series or two.</p><p>Miami at Houston</p><p>Miami head coach Mike McDaniel has said that Tua Tagovailoa will play at least one preseason game. He hasn&rsquo;t stated yet if Tua is going to play in this one and with OT Terron Armstead injured (not seriously), he might want to hold off on playing him at all. That means a lot of Skylar Thompson and Mike White for Week 2.</p><p>Houston has named rookie C.J. Stroud as the starter and he should see time again this week as he needs the reps. Davis Mills might be the better quarterback now, but Stroud has the upside.</p><p>Buffalo at Pittsburgh</p><p>Josh Allen is expected to start and play into the second quarter with the rest of the starters. Matt Barkley should take over the rest of the way.</p><p>Pittsburgh will play their starters including QB Kenny Pickett. Mike Tomlin hasn&rsquo;t indicated how long they will remain in there. Mitch Tribusky and Mason Rudolph will clean up.</p><p>Chicago at Indianapolis</p><p>Justin Fields won&rsquo;t play for the Bears in this one. That means that star WR D.J. Moore will likely sit in this one. He already showed what he was capable of doing last week with a short pass that went for a long TD. They do need to find a more consistent performance from backup P.J. Walker.</p><p>The Colts will start Anthony Richardson, who was named the starter for the regular season. Gardner Minshew is a very good security blanket if Richardson struggles. Unfortunately for the Colts, they lost promising DE Genard Avery to a serious knee injury to end his 2023 season.</p><p>Tampa Bay at NY Jets</p><p>This is Kyle Trask&rsquo;s time to shine. Baker Mayfield will probably end up starting in the regular season so Trask better put on a good show. He will be without WR Russell Gage, who suffered a serious knee injury on Wednesday.</p><p>The Jets should be loaded at running back now that Dalvin Cook has signed and Breece Hall is back at practice. This is their third game, but Aaron Rodgers doesn&rsquo;t need preseason. Zach Wilson has shown some flashes that he could be a solid quarterback and should have more playing time.</p><p>New England at Green Bay</p><p>Bill Belichick is not big on giving out gameplans, even in preseason. The question is whether rookie QB Malik Cunningham will play wide receiver or quarterback. Yet he played well last week at quarterback last week.</p><p>Jordan Love has played pretty well in practice against a good New England defense this past week. He&rsquo;ll get another chance on Saturday to play, though not sure how long. Rookie Sean Clifford should get another long look to show if he can be the backup.</p><p>Tennessee at Minnesota</p><p>The Titans might not have rookie QB Will Levis, who was injured last week. That would mean a lot of Malik Willis. Ryan Tannehill hasn&rsquo;t played in a preseason game since 2018. WR Treylon Burks suffered an LCL sprain in practice on Tuesday and will miss several weeks.</p><p>The Vikings will look at their reserves including QB Jarren Hall. Nick Mullens should get the start over veteran Kirk Cousins, who has nothing to prove in the preseason.</p><p>Kansas City at Arizona</p><p>Andy Reid will play the starters including Patrick Mahomes about a half on Saturday. Mahomes will likely just play 2-3 series at the most.</p><p>Arizona may play starting QB Colt McCoy some after not playing in Game 1. Rookie QB Clayton Tune should get the most playing time again.</p><p>Denver at San Francisco</p><p>Sean Payton played Russell Wilson last week so there&rsquo;s no need to play the aging but thinner QB this week. That means a lot of Jarrett Stidham, who didn&rsquo;t fare well last week.</p><p>The 49ers could play Brock Purdy, but since he saw a lot of reps in their scrimmage against the Broncos, it seems unlikely. Sam Darnold will likely get the start an he was awful on Thursday. Trey Lance wasn&rsquo;t very good last week, so the 49ers need somebody to play well at that position on Saturday.</p><p>Las Vegas at LA Rams</p><p>Rookie QB Aidan O&rsquo;Connell had a strong debut against the 49ers last week in a 34-7 win. He should get another strong chance, which is important considering that starter Jimmy Garoppolo is injury-prone.</p><p>The Rams and Sean McVay don&rsquo;t care about the preseason. Though rookie Stetson Bennett should get more time this week as he most likely gets the backup job over veteran Brett Rypien.</p><p>Dallas at Seattle</p><p>Don&rsquo;t expect Dak Prescott and Tony Pollard to suit up for this one. There will be a lot of Cooper Rush and Will Grier in this one.</p><p>Geno Smith might want to play, but Drew Lock will play and get a lot of time again for the Seahawks. First-round receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and second-round pick Zach Charbonnet will get some time as well.</p><p>Sunday August 20th, 2023</p><p>New Orleans at LA Chargers:</p><p>Derek Carr got some action for the home team last week. No need for the veteran to play on the road. Jameis Winston and Jake Haener should see the first half and second half respectively.</p><p>Brandon Staley is another coach who isn&rsquo;t big on playing starters in the preseason. New OC Kellen Moore will be on the sidelines trying to coach up Easton Stick and Max Duggan at quarterback.</p><p>Monday, August 21</p><p>Baltimore at Washington</p><p>John Harbaugh attempts to go for 25 straight preseason wins in this one. This will be a tougher test, especially if backup Tyler Huntley (hamstring) can&rsquo;t go. That means a full half for Josh Johnson and Anthony Brown. Their secondary has also been decimated not just due to Marlon Humphrey&rsquo;s foot injury.</p><p>Washington will start Sam Howell at quarterback and he was also officially named the starter. The Washington defensive front is one of the best in the game and should see some time this week along with the offensive line, which has had its troubles.</p>
