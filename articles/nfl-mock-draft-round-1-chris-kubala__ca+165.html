                        <p>We&rsquo;re just a couple of days away from the biggest thing in sports that people can currently lay wagers on the NFL Draft. The first round takes place Thursday, the second and third rounds are Friday and the fourth through seventh rounds close things out on Saturday. With that said, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how the first round could play out, at least from my own perspective. This doesn&rsquo;t take into account potential trades, rumors, speculation or any other situations. We&rsquo;ll base the picks solely on the team currently holding the pick and the needs they have to fill in order to become a viable playoff contender. With that said, let&rsquo;s get to the list:</p><p><strong>1) </strong><strong>Cincinnati Bengals: QB Joe Burrow, LSU</strong></p><p><br />This one is a no-brainer. The reigning Heisman Trophy winner threw 60 scoring passes while leading LSU to the title last season. He played high school football in Ohio and started his career at Ohio State before transferring. Unlike when the Bengals had a chance to draft Steve Young first overall in 1984 only to see him ink a deal with the USFL&rsquo;s Los Angeles Express. Unlike then, when Mike Brown stated that he would match the Express&rsquo; offer if he &ldquo;found an oil field under Spinney Field&rdquo; (which was the Bengals practice field at the time), Burrow should be ready to sign and get his career going.</p><p><strong>2) </strong><strong>Washington Redskins: DE Chase Young, Ohio State</strong></p><p>There have been increasing reports that teams have been contacting the Redskins about potentially acquiring this pick. On the flip side, the reports that Washington won&rsquo;t give up the pick remain rampant as well. Young is arguably the top pass rusher in the draft and Washington needs help in that department. He racked up 16.5 sacks last year and could easily bolster the Redskins&rsquo; ability to get after the quarterback. On the flip side, Washington has a lot of problems that need to be addressed.</p><p><strong>3) </strong><strong>Detroit Lions: CB Jeff Okudah, Ohio State</strong></p><p>Detroit needs a corner after dealing Darius Slay to Philadelphia earlier this offseason. Okudah has decent size and the capability to shut down opposing receivers. He&rsquo;s athletic and will make plays against both the pass and the run game. There are reports percolating that Detroit could deal out of the pick, which may affect where Okudah goes, number-wise, but the Lions would be his best fit.</p><p><strong>4) </strong><strong>New York Giants: OT Tristan Wirfs, Iowa</strong></p><p>I projected Wirfs as the top pick for the Giants because Daniel Jones can ill afford to keep taking hits and coughing up the ball on a regular basis. There is the potential that Alabama&rsquo;s Jedrick Wills could be the call here but the ability of Wirfs to play either tackle spot or guard gives the Giants a little flexibility in their offensive line. Fans of Big Blue have to hope that Dave Gettleman doesn&rsquo;t screw things up.</p><p><strong>5) </strong><strong>Miami Dolphins: QB Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama</strong></p><p>Sure, there are red flags about Tagovailoa&rsquo;s health after the hip surgery he had at the end of last season. He has a ton of talent and upside if he can stay healthy, and Miami clearly needs a quarterback at this stage of the game. Josh Rosen didn&rsquo;t pan out and Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the twilight of his career. Tagovailoa did toss 87 touchdown passes and added nine scores on the ground. He doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have the size that a prototypical QB does at 6&rsquo;1, 218 but Miami hopes that he gives them a franchise QB.</p><p><strong>6) </strong><strong>LA Chargers: QB Justin Herbert, Oregon</strong></p><p>LA saw Philip Rivers leave town after spending his entire career with the team in the offseason. That leaves Tyrod Taylor as the veteran option right now on the roster and it means that the Bolts need to bring in a new quarterback to build the future. Herbert completed 64 percent of his passes for 10,541 yards with 95 touchdown passes and 23 interceptions while adding 13 scores on the ground. He is a big QB at 6&rsquo;6, 237 and would step into a team with talented options in the passing game.</p><p><strong>7) </strong><strong>Carolina Panthers: DT Derrick Brown, Auburn</strong></p><p>Carolina was hit by a slew of departures in the offseason, especially on the defensive side of the ball. It&rsquo;s clear that they could use at least one playmaker in each defensive group but Brown is a disruptive force in the front four. He finished with 54 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss, four sacks, two forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, and four pass defenses last season. At 6&rsquo;5, 318, Brown has the ability to tie up blockers and penetrate the backfield to blow up plays. He gets the nod over CB C.J. Henderson from Florida and Clemson LB Isaiah Simmons.</p><p><strong>8) </strong><strong>Arizona Cardinals: OT Jedrick Wills, Alabama</strong></p><p>Arizona is in a similar situation with the Giants: they have a young quarterback that has mobility but a suspect offensive line. Wills would be a good pickup for the Cardinals as it would help keep Kyler Murray from absorbing hits and open holes for Kenyan Drake on the ground. That would only benefit Murray as staying upright would create plenty of targets for Larry Fitzgerald and DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game.</p><p><strong>9) </strong><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars: CB C.J. Henderson, Florida</strong></p><p>Jacksonville has all kinds of problems on both sides of the ball. You have Yannick Ngakoue in a war of words on Twitter with ownership. Nick Foles was traded, Marquise Lee was released and Leonard Fournette is rumored to be dealt. Last season, Jacksonville traded Jalen Ramsey to the Rams and in the offseason dealt A.J. Bouye to Denver. Henderson has good size, like Okudah, and is capable of making plays in the secondary. With Jacksonville having major holes at corner, they could do worse than picking him up to plug into the lineup.</p><p><strong>10) </strong><strong>Cleveland Browns: T Andrew Thomas, Georgia</strong></p><p>The Browns are trying to stabilize their offensive line and there are reports that they are looking at picking up Trent Williams from Washington if a deal can be struck. With that in mind, should they be unable to consummate a deal, picking up Thomas would be a nice boost for the Browns. He started his career at right tackle before flipping to left tackle in his last two years with the program. Adding Thomas would be a boost for Baker Mayfield, Nick Chubb, and the Browns&rsquo; skill players.</p><p><strong>11) </strong><strong>New York Jets: T Mekhi Becton, Louisville</strong></p><p>The Jets need a road grader on the offensive line as Sam Darnold needs some protection. Becton is a force at 6&rsquo;7, 369 and would definitely fill a void on the Jets. New York could target a receiver like Jerry Jeudy, CeeDee Lamb or Henry Ruggs III but without a line to block, you could have the greatest receivers in the league and not have it matter. Becton did fail a drug test at the combine but it&rsquo;s a deviation from his track record.</p><p><strong>12) </strong><strong>Las Vegas Raiders: LB Isaiah Simmons, Clemson</strong></p><p>The Raiders would jump for joy if they had the ability to grab Simmons here. He&rsquo;s an excellent mix of size (6&rsquo;3, 238) and speed (4.39 40-yard dash time) where he could fit in either at linebacker, edge rusher or from a safety position. He can go sideline to sideline and drop back in coverage or go after the quarterback without a drop in performance.</p><p><strong>13) </strong><strong>San Francisco 49ers: WR Jerry Jeudy, Alabama</strong></p><p>San Francisco lost Emmanuel Sanders to free agency in the offseason and their top pass-catching threat is a tight end, George Kittle. Deebo Samuel had a solid showing last season but adding Jeudy to the mix would be a major boost for the 49ers passing game. Jeudy has speed, the ability to make plays in traffic and would add another weapon to the passing game for Jimmy Garoppolo. That would definitely make the 49ers that much more dangerous given their run game.</p><p><strong>14) </strong><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers: T Josh Jones, Houston</strong></p><p>Tampa Bay has plenty of skill position players offensively and the addition of quarterback Tom Brady was a big move for the team in free agency. The Buccaneers could trade up to ensure picking up one of the top four tackles but Jones is no slouch. He had a big senior year and had a great showing at the combine. Tampa Bay could take him and be happy with their selection.</p><p><strong>15) </strong><strong>Denver Broncos: WR CeeDee Lamb, Oklahoma</strong></p><p>Denver has a need for playmakers at the receiver position and Lamb fits the bill. He has the ability to get up the field and is dynamic enough to slip or break tackles. The Broncos could use another receiving option to go opposite Courtland Sutton and tight end Noah Fant to help Drew Lock&rsquo;s adjustment to the NFL game. Lamb can fit that bill, as could Henry Ruggs III should Lamb be off the board.</p><p><strong>16) </strong><strong>Atlanta Falcons: DT Javon Kinlaw, South Carolina</strong></p><p>The Falcons are in need of some playmakers on the defensive side of the ball. They added Dante Fowler Jr. in free agency but could use another force on their defensive line. Picking up a guy like Kinlaw can only help get the most out of Fowler Jr., who had 11.5 sacks playing alongside Aaron Donald last season. Kinlaw also can help Grady Jarrett in the middle of the defensive line, collapsing the pocket.</p><p><strong>17) </strong><strong>Dallas Cowboys: DE K&rsquo;Lavon Chiasson, LSU</strong></p><p>Dallas is looking to add to their defensive line, especially after losing Robert Quinn in free agency. Chaisson recorded 60 tackles (34 solo), 13.5 tackles for loss, 6.5 sacks and forced a fumble last season for LSU en route to the national title. While a guy like Trevon Diggs or Xavier McKinney could be popular choices here after their secondary was raided in the offseason, you can&rsquo;t afford to pass up a guy that can get after the QB.</p><p><strong>18) </strong><strong>Miami Dolphins: S Xavier McKinney, Alabama</strong></p><p>Miami would have loved to get an offensive tackle here but with the top five off the board, they go after one of the top DBs in McKinney. The Dolphins let Reshad Jones go in the offseason and after throwing a truckload of money at Byron Jones, adding McKinney helps stabilize the backline of the defense. He racked up 95 tackles (59 solo), 5.5 tackles for loss, five pass defenses, four forced fumbles, three sacks, three picks, and a forced fumble last season.</p><p><strong>19) </strong><strong>Oakland Raiders: LB Kenneth Murray, Oklahoma</strong></p><p>Oakland has a glaring hole at the linebacker spot that was created, in part, by the dealing of Khalil Mack a couple of years ago. The Raiders, if the draft breaks this way, could patch up those holes in this draft by getting Simmons at 12 and then Murray here. He was a force in the last couple of seasons. After racking up 155 tackles and 12.5 tackles for loss as a sophomore, he followed that up with 102 tackles and 17.5 tackles for loss last year. This would be a terrific addition to the Raiders defense.</p><p><strong>20) </strong><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars: T Austin Jackson, USC</strong></p><p>Jacksonville needs serious help on their offensive line if they hope to have success going forward. In that case, Jackson is the best option for an offensive tackle to add to the mix. He was up and down a little bit last season but that can be chalked up to giving bone marrow to his sister. The Jaguars are in a state of rebuild and bringing in an anchor on their O-line can&rsquo;t hurt in that regard.</p><p><strong>21) </strong><strong>Philadelphia Eagles: WR Henry Ruggs III, Alabama</strong></p><p>After getting Darius Slay and Nickell Robey-Coleman in the offseason in order to bolster their secondary, the Eagles can move their focus to a different spot here. That allows them to bring in a potential threat at the receiver position. Ruggs III is a bit raw but can make the big plays after averaging 18.7 yards per catch and seven scores last season. He or Justin Jefferson from LSU are likely the best options for the Eagles here but I leaned toward Ruggs III thanks to his speed.</p><p><strong>22) </strong><strong>Minnesota Vikings: WR Justin Jefferson, LSU</strong></p><p>Minnesota made a move in the offseason, dealing Stefon Diggs to Buffalo for several draft picks. While adding a corner could be in the cards for the Vikings, Kirk Cousins needs some weapons to replace Diggs, who was their lone consistent playmaker last season. Jefferson has the size (6&rsquo;3, 192 pounds) and the frame where he could add 15 to 20 pounds of muscle. He had a huge year last season for the Tigers and would be a major boost to the passing game for the Vikings alongside Adam Thielen.</p><p><strong>23) </strong><strong>New England Patriots: LB Zack Baun, Wisconsin</strong></p><p>New England has all kinds of holes after a tumultuous offseason that saw plenty of pieces leave town. The Patriots lost two of their starting linebackers and another capable depth piece in Elandon Roberts. New England could easily trade up or down, depending on the situation. They could target Jordan Love here should he still be on the board. Still, the Patriots have some work to do on the defensive side of things and Baun, who racked up 75 tackles (52 solo), 19.5 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks last season, could fit that bill.</p><p><strong>24) </strong><strong>New Orleans Saints: LB Patrick Queen, LSU</strong></p><p>The Saints could use another linebacker to put in the mix on their defense and Queen was white-hot down the stretch last season. He has the ability to go from sideline to sideline, making plays in coverage and against the run. While Jordan Love could be a trendy pick here to learn behind Drew Brees, New Orleans is likely to kick the can down the road and try patching their defense.</p><p><strong>25) </strong><strong>Minnesota Vikings: CB A.J. Terrell, Clemson</strong></p><p>Minnesota has a need at corner as they try to retool their defense on the fly. Terrell is a very good option that could step up and contribute almost immediately. At 6&rsquo;1, he has the height and size, much like Okudah and Jefferson, to make plays defensively. The Vikings could also look at Jaylon Johnson here should Terrell end up off the board by this point.</p><p><strong>26) </strong><strong>Miami Dolphins: RB D&rsquo;Andre Swift, Georgia</strong></p><p>Miami has their third pick of the opening round here and, after drafting a QB and safety in their first two picks, adds a running back. There isn&rsquo;t much in the way of faith in the running back room for the team with the underwhelming Jordan Howard the expected starter. Swift averaged 6.2 yards per carry last season and racked up 1,218 yards on the ground. He&rsquo;d be a solid addition to give another talented skill position player to the mix for the rebuilding Dolphins.</p><p><strong>27) </strong><strong>Seattle Seahawks: DT Raekwon Davis, Alabama</strong></p><p>Seattle likes to pull one over on people by making moves that no one saw coming. The Seahawks may well trade down at this point to pick up an extra pick or two but the fact remains that they need some help on the defensive line. Davis is a big body in the middle that can tie up blockers and help out the rest of that defense. Other potential options for this spot could be Josh Uche from Michigan, A.J. Espenesa from Iowa or Marlon Davidson from Auburn.</p><p><strong>28) </strong><strong>Baltimore Ravens: RB Jonathan Taylor, Wisconsin</strong></p><p>Baltimore had a punishing ground game last season but they struggled in the postseason after Mark Ingram II suffered an injury in the loss to Tennessee. While the Ravens could make a move to add to their defensive front seven, Taylor seems like a good fit to the mix for Baltimore at this point as he&rsquo;s a bruising back that has the ability to get to the outside. He racked up 6,174 yards and 50 scores in three seasons for Wisconsin, averaging 6.7 yards per carry. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with that type of production.</p><p><strong>29) </strong><strong>Tennessee Titans: CB Kristian Fulton, LSU</strong></p><p>The Titans saw Logan Ryan and Tramaine Brock hit the open market via free agency this season. When two of your top three corners aren&rsquo;t in the fold (and there&rsquo;s at least a chance that one or both returns), the fact remains that you need to add to the depth chart. Fulton was a solid corner in the SEC with the Tigers and would be a nice fit for the Titans under coach Mike Vrabel.</p><p><strong>30) </strong><strong>Green Bay Packers: WR Denzel Mims, Baylor</strong></p><p>Green Bay has a definite need for playmaking receivers for The Matt LaFleur offense. Aaron Rodgers needs to get some weapons if the Packers hope to make a run to the Super Bowl. Mims had a solid senior season at Baylor and followed that up with a great Senior Bowl showing plus a stellar combine performance. Mims has the size (6&rsquo;3, 215) and the speed to contribute right out of the gate and give the Packers a solid secondary receiver.</p><p><strong>31) </strong><strong>San Francisco 49ers: C/G Cesar Ruiz, Michigan</strong></p><p>The 49ers need some interior line help to bolster their offensive line and keep their punishing ground game going. Weston Richburg suffered a torn patellar tendon last December and while the team hopes that he&rsquo;ll be ready for training camp, the fact remains that serious knee injuries can really take a toll on offensive linemen. Ruiz is a solid pickup who can either take over for Richburg out of the gate or solidify the middle of the line for San Francisco.</p><p><strong>32) </strong><strong>Kansas City Chiefs: CB Jeff Gladney, TCU</strong></p><p>Kansas City is coming off their first Lombardi Trophy in a half-century but they still have a couple of rough spots. Kendall Fuller left in free agency and the Chiefs could use a replacement option here. Gladney is a solid corner that had plenty of experience in the pass-happy Big 12 and he would be well-suited to fit in with the Chiefs&rsquo; needs. Travon Diggs or Jaylon Johnson could also be in play here.</p><p>There you go, the first round as I see it playing out. Tune in Thursday to see how well (or how poorly) we all did with our predictions.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>
