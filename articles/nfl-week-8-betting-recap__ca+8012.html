                        <p><strong>NFL Week 8 Betting Recap</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The season is really moving fast. There were some bizarre plays that may have cost people betting pools, parlays, teasers and regular bets. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each game and look at the betting implications that occurred and may also affect the line in Week 9 and beyond.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>(closing lines)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Thursday, Oct.</strong></p><p><strong>NFL </strong></p><p><strong>Thursday, Oct. 27</strong></p><p><strong>Baltimore (+2.5) over TAMPA BAY 27-22<br /></strong>A bizarre game but at least a rare entertaining one on Thursday night. The Bucs were up 10-3 at the half as Lamar Jackson threw it 30 times for Baltimore who tried to attack the decimated Bucs&rsquo; secondary. In the second half, the Ravens ran more and scored the first two TDs to go up 17-10. Tampa Bay was held to two field goals and scored a late TD to make the score more palatable. But it was the Ravens who ran all over the Bucs for 231 yards and Jackson who ran for 43 yards and threw for 238 and two TDs. Tom Brady completed 26 of 44 for 325 yards and one TD, but they ran for just 44 yards on 15 carries. The Buccaneers have numerous injuries on the defensive side. Baltimore is starting to get healthy, but might not have RB Gus Edwards (hamstring) for MNF.</p><p>Sunday, Oct. 30</p><p>Denver (+1.5) over JACKSONVILLE (from London) 21-17</p><p>Russell Wilson returned from a hamstring injury to throw for 252 yards and Latavius Murray rushed for a two-yard TD with 1:43 left to give the Broncos a neutral site win. Trevor Lawrence really struggled for the Jags with 133 yards passing and two interceptions. This was Jacksonville&rsquo;s ninth straight loss in a row by one score, which includes all six of their losses this season. A bright spot for the Jags was the play of RB Travis Etienne, who had 156 yards on 24 carries. A bright spot for the Broncos on offense was the play of T Greg Dulcich, who caught four passes for 87 yards. Denver has a bye this week though they just traded star DE Bradley Chubb to Miami.</p><p>DALLAS (-9.5) over Chicago 49-29</p><p>There&rsquo;s not much to say about this one other than Dak Prescott is really back. He was very sharp going 21 of 27 for 250 yards with two TDs and a pick. Tony Pollard, starting for the injured Zeke Elliott (knee), rushed for 131 yards and three TDs. The Bears were playing on a short week after winning on MNF. QB Justin Field threw for 2 TDs and ran for 60 yards and one TD. The Bears traded LB Roquan Smith to Baltimore, but picked up WR Chase Claypool in a trade with the Steelers. Dallas has a bye this week.</p><p>New England (-3.5) over NY JETS 22-17</p><p>The Jets opened this game up 10-6 as they got their tempo and were abloe to keep the Patriots out of the end zone. But ultimately, Mac Jones caught fire in the second half and the Jets&rsquo; offense was limited to a late touchdown pass from Zach Wilson to Tyle Conklin, for his second TD of the day. Wilson had a rough game, going 20-of-41 for 355 yards with two TDs and THREE INTs. The loss of rookie RB Breece Hall to a season-ending knee injury saw the Jets rush for just 51 yards. New England ran for 127 yards, but they won the turnover battle (+2) and that was the difference. The Jets hope that WR Corey Davis (MCL) could return for Sunday&rsquo;s matchup with Buffalo.</p><p>Miami (-3.5) over DETROIT 31-27</p><p>Here is a tough game for Detroit bettors. The Lions owned a 21-7 lead in the second quarter and a 27-17 lead at the half. But no lead is safe for this Detroit defense. Tua Tagovailoa threw for 382 yards and three TDs to lead the Fins to the comeback win. Jared Goff threw for 321 yards and a TD, but the Lions were shut out in the second half. RB De&rsquo;Andre Swift returned for the Lions but ran for just six yards on five carries. Jamaal Williams ran for 53 yards and two TDs for the Lions. The Fins added RB Jeff Wilson from San Francisco and DE Bradley Chubb from Denver in big draft day deals.</p><p>NEW ORLEANS (+1.5) over Las Vegas 24-0</p><p>In one of the shocking scores of the day, the Raiders were a complete no-show. They couldn&rsquo;t run the ball (38 yards), despite having a red-hot Josh Jacobs. They couldn&rsquo;t stop the run as Alvin Kamar and Taysom Hill combined for 123 yards. Derek Carr threw for just 101 yars and one INT and was pulled late in the game for Jarrett Stidham. Andy Dalton was an efficient 22 of 30 for 229 yards and two TD passes to Kamara. Star WR Davante Adams caught just one pass for three yards. The Raiders were hoping to have TE Darren Waller (hamstring) for this game, but he couldn&rsquo;t go in warm ups.</p><p>MINNESOTA (-4.5) over Arizona 34-26</p><p>Minnesota improved to 6-1 with a solid win over a 3-5 Cardinals team. Kirk Cousins threw for two TDs and ran for one. Arizona had a 17-14 leads in the third quarter and couldn&rsquo;t hold on. The problem? Kyler Murray threw two picks and was the leading rusher with 36 yards on six carries. DeAndre Hopkins had a big game with 12 catches for 159 yards and one TD, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Arizona&rsquo;s run defense struggled as well, allowing 173 yards to Dalvin Cook (111 yds) and company. Vikes OLB Za&rsquo;Darius Smith (NFL sack leader) is questionable for this week along with WR Adam Thielen. TE Irvin Smith (ankle) is out but the Vikings just traded for TE T.J. Hockenson from Detroit.</p><p>Carolina (+4.5) over ATLANTA 34-37ot</p><p>This was a crazy game as the Panthers once again gave it their all despite the fact that their front office is tanking. But after saying that, Atlanta had a six-point lead with 12 seconds left and allowed P.J. Walker to throw a 62-yard Hail Mary pass hit D.J. Moore in the end zone to tie the game. Unfortunately for the Panthers, Moore was called for a penalty for removing his helmet and Eddy Pineiro missed a longer extra point. He also missed field goal in overtime and the Falcons capitalized by going down the field an having Younghoe-Koo nailing a 41-yard field goal. Walker was impressive with 317 yards passing with one TD and one pick. It looks like he&rsquo;ll be starting the rest of the way. Marcus Mariota was solid with 253 yards passing and three TDs, but also had two picks. Atlanta also has major issues at cornerback with A.J. Terrell (hamstring) and DB Rashad Fenton (hamstring) both listed as questionable for this week.</p><p>PHILADELPHIA (-11) over Pittsburgh 35-13</p><p>It was the A.J. Brown show in Philadelphia on Sunday against the Steelers. The former Titans&rsquo; wideout caught six passes for 156 yards and three TDs (all in the first half). Philly had a 21-10 lead at the half but instead of cruising in the second half, they poured it on with two more scores in the second half. Jalen Hurts was an efficient 19-for-28 for 285 yards and four TDs with no picks. Rookie Kenny Pickett was held to 191 yards passing with a pick and fumble. It&rsquo;s been a long first half of the season for Pittsburgh, who fell to 2-6 and gave up on WR Chase Claypool, sending him to the Bears for second-round pick. The Eagles improved to 7-0 and with DE Robert Quinn coming on board, their defense is elite.</p><p>Tennessee (-1.5) over HOUSTON 17-10</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty start for rookie Malik Willis, the former Liberty/Auburn quarterback who threw just 10 passes for 55 yards and a pick. But he didn&rsquo;t need to be great or even average with Derrick Henry rushing for 219 yards and two TDs against the lowly Texans. Amazingly, it was the fourth straight 200-yard game by Henry against Houston. The Titans ran for over 300 yards and tossed just one pass in the second half. QB Ryan Tannehill (ankle/illness) should return this week to a Tennessee team sitting in first place in the lowly AFC South.</p><p>SEATTLE (-3) over NY Giants 27-13</p><p>The Giants&rsquo; luck finally ran out. At 13-all in the fourth quarter, it looked as though the Giants could steal another one on the road. But Geno Smith connected on a 33-yard pass to Tyler Lockett (who earlier lost a fumble at the Seattle 2 and dropped a potential TD in the 3rd QTr) and rookie Kenneth Walker III added a 16-yard insurance TD run to pull away at the end. The story was New York falling to 6-2, but also Seattle improving to 5-3. Smith was efficient again with 212 yards passing and two TDs. Smith is having an MVP season with 1,924 yards passing, 72.7% completion rate, 13 TD and just three INTs.</p><p>San Francisco (+1) over LA RAMS 31-14</p><p>It was the Christian McCaffrey show in Los Angeles as CMC cranked out a 34-yard passing TD, a nine-yard receiving score and a one-yard TD plunge to become the first NFL player with a touchdown hat trick since LaDainian Tomlinson since 2005. The 49ers also did it without star WR Deebo Samuel, who was out with a hamstring injury. He&rsquo;s considered questionable once again this week. As for the Rams, Matthew Stafford had a rushing and passing TD but threw for a season-low 187 yards. Cooper Kupp caught eight passes for 79 yards and a score, but for some reason, was still in a blowout with 1:02 left and injured his ankle. Kupp did not practice on Wednesday and considered ? at Tampa Bay.</p><p>Washington (+1.5) over INDIANAPOLIS 17-16</p><p>In an ugly game and a battle of backup (kind of) quarterbacks, the Commanders moved to .500 and won their third straight with a one-point win over the Colts. Sam Ehlinger wasn&rsquo;t bad in his first start, passing for 201 yards. Jonathan Taylor, who still hampered by an ankle sprain, had 76 yards rushing. But it came down to the last drive, where Taylor Heinicke came up with a one-yard run with 22 seconds left to cap off an 89-yard drive. The Colts (3-4-1) blew a 16-7 lead in the fourth quarter and fell at home. Another concern for the Colts is the health of cornerback Stephon Gilmore (ribs).</p><p>Green Bay (+10.5) over BUFFALO 17-27</p><p>One of those games where you knew you should have bought the half point or might get hurt by the hook if you took the Bills. Buffalo dominated most of the game and led 24-7 at the half. But the Bills&rsquo; vaunted run defense was a no-show in the second half as the Packers rushed for 208 total yards and were able to make the game interesting. Josh Allen didn&rsquo;t help the Bills by throwing a pick in the red zone and two overall. Aaron Jones rushed for 143 yards for Green Bay, who fell to 3-5. At this point, with the Packers unable to trade for a receiver and unless Odell Beckham Jr. decides to sign with Green Bay, they are on the outside looking in for the playoffs.</p><p>Monday, Oct. 31</p><p>CLEVELAND (+3) over Cincinnati 32-13</p><p>The Bengals certainly missed star WR Ja&rsquo;Marr Chase (hip), but they also couldn&rsquo;t block Myles Garrett and company, sacked Joe Burrow five times. Jacoby Brissett tossed for 278 yards and a TD. Nick Chubb ran for 101 yards and two TDs. On the other side, Cincy ran for just 36 yards and allowed 172 yards. The Bengals have issues in the secondary with Chidobe Awuzie (ACL) out fo the season and CB Eli Apple having hamstring problems.</p>
