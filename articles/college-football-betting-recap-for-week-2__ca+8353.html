                        <p>College Football Betting Recap for Week 2</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the interesting things that happened in college football this week, betting-wise, as well as some of the upsets and surprising results that took place in Week 2.</p><p>*Let&rsquo;s start with No. 4 Texas, who shocked now No. 10 Alabama on Saturday from Tuscaloosa.</p><p>In some ways, this was not a shocker as Texas upset Alabama 34-24 as a 7.5-point underdog. The Longhorns consistently recruit some of the best players in the nation. At some point, former Alabama assistant Steve Sarkisian was going to turn things around. With Quinn Ewers throwing for 349 yards and three TDs against a shaky Alabama secondary, he has the time on the right path. Nick Saban and Alabama will be fine, but they are the dominant squad they used to be.</p><p>*No. 22 Miami (unranked before the game) beat then No. 23 Texas A&M 48-33 as a 2.5-point dog.</p><p>This was not a shocking result, but the score was a bit surprising. Tyler Van Dyke threw a career-high five TDs (three to Jacolby George). The only issue for the Hurricanes came on special teams when they had a kick blocked, and fumbled a punt, both of which led to two touchdowns. Texas A&M QB Casey Weighman threw for 336 yards and two TDs, but also two picks. The heat is on again for Jimbo Fisher at College Station.</p><p>*No. 25 Iowa beats Iowa State on the road 20-13 as a 3.5-point favorite</p><p>If you had the Under 34.5, you were once again a winner if you went under playing the Hawkeyes. Iowa State is a bit of a mess after a gambling scandal that saw QB Hunter Dekker and six other players involved. To their credit, they came back from being down 20-3. But it was ugly for the Iowa offense once again as new QB Cade McNamara threw for 123 yards and a pick. The good news is that Kirk Ferentz picked up his 200th win.</p><p>*Colorado (-2.5) over Nebraska 36-14</p><p>Coach Prime has people believing. He has two special players in his son QB Shedeur Sanders, who threw for 393 yards and three TDs and two-way player Travis Hunter, who had three catches and four tackles. Xavier Spencer had an incredible game with 10 catches for 170 yards. If you&rsquo;re a Nebraska fan, this is more of a rebuilding season under Matt Rhule. QB Jeff Sims had a disastrous game for the second straight week, turning the ball over three times including two dropped shotgun snap. CU will be tested as the season goes on and they&rsquo;ll need to protect Sanders better (12 sacks) and run the ball more efficiently (1.7ypc).</p><p>*Purdue (-1) over Virginia Tech 24-17</p><p>You have to give the fans credit who stayed through this game, which included a weather delay of more than five hours. This game was tied at 17-17 at the half and Purdue did enough to win. But the game was delayed with 5:50 left in the first quarter and it didn&rsquo;t resume until 6:15pmET. Virginia Tech appeared to take over the game after being down 17-0, but couldn&rsquo;t do anything offensively in the second half. This is a very tough game to judge considering the delay. The good news for Purdue is that the bounced back from a home loss to Fresno State and Hudson Card was solid, throwing for 248 yards with no TDs and no picks.</p><p>*Then No. 19 Wisconsin fell at unranked Washington State 31-22 as a 5.5-point favorite</p><p>Wisconsin was down 24-9 at the half and nearly came back to win this game, at 24-22. But last season, the Badgers lost 17-14 at Madison. Carmon Ward threw for 212 yards and two TDs, while rushing for 43 yards. But the Badgers were held to 90 yards rushing on 29 attempts and also lost three fumbles. SMU transfer Tanner Mordecai completed 25 of 40 for 278 yards with a TD, but Wisconsin football is all about establishing the run. Washington State took advantage of the turnovers to their credit, but this is a team that could be a factor in the Pac-12.</p><p>*No. 12 Utah (-7.5/7) over Baylor 20-13</p><p>The Pac-12 is loaded this season. Utah needs QB Cam Rising back. They beat Baylor with some shaky QB play, but rushed for 153 yards. Their defense was fantastic, especially in the second half, as they held the Bears to just three points. Baylor was the right side as Utah needed an 8:02, 15-play, 88-yard drive with 1:59 left to win the game. Baylor QB Sawyer Robertson struggled with 218 yards passing and two picks. He drove the team down the field at the end, but his pass in the end zone fell incomplete as time expired as the Bears fell to 0-2 on the season.</p><p>UCF (-5.5) over Boise State 18-16</p><p>Boise covers this game as QB John Rhys Plumlee throws two picks for UCF, but the Knights were able to kick the game-winning FG as time expired to improve to 2-0. The unfortunate part for UCF is that Plumlee, who ran for 73 yards and threw for 272, will miss the next few weeks due to a leg injury. Timmy McClain, a transfer from USF, will start while Plumlee is out. McClain passed for 53 yards and rushed for 21 yards in a 56-6 win over Kent State. This was a tough loss for Boise State, which was outclassed by Washington (56-19) in the first game.</p>
