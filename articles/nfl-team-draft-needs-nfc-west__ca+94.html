                        <p><h3>NFL Team Draft Needs</h3></p><p>NFL general managers will have to rely mainly on scouting from the college football season and the NFL Combine instead of working out players individually. But these are difficult times so teams will need to adjust to the circumstances. We'll take a look at the NFL Draft over the next couple of weeks, starting with the needs of each NFL team, adjusted through NFL free agency. For handicappers out there, we are going to keep you informed about all the moves made before the draft, the top picks each team has and what their Super Bowl odds are. Let's take a look at the NFC South, which gets a boost from some young quarterback named Tom Brady.</p><p>(some stats from Athlon Sports)</p><p>NFC West</p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p>2019: 5-10-1</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 50-1</p><p>First pick: No. 8</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: WR DeAndre Hopkins (Trade Texans), LB Devon Kennard (Lions), LB De'Vondre Campbell (Falcons).</p><p>Key Losses: RB David Johnson (Texans), WR Damiere Byrd (Patriots), WR Pharoh Cooper (Panthers), DE Rodney Gunter (Jaguars), LB Joe Walker (49ers).</p><p>Needs: OT, Edge, LB, WR, CB, TE</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>Arizona made a huge splash in the off-season, with the acquisition of WR DeAndre Hopkins from Houston for RB David Johnson. Hopkins is an elite receiver, coming off 104 catches for 1,165 yards and seven TDs. He and Larry Fitzgerald will give Kyle Murray two big weapons who have great hands. Christian Kirk can be the speed receiver and they have a young player in Andy Isabella, who rarely played in his rookie season. He was moved to the slot after playing outside at UMass and the results were not good. Grabbing another receiver considering Fitzgerald might retire after this season is crucial. Fortunately, this is a very deep draft at receiver.</p><p>Arizona is fortunate Murray is very mobile, because their offensive line last season struggled. Marcus Gilbert was re-signed to a one-year deal, but he played in just 12 games over the past three seasons. Tackles D.J. Humphries and Justin Murray are both free agents so at No. 8, drafting an OT is a possibility. Mekhi Becton from Louisville and Tristan Wirfs from Iowa are the top two tackles that could be available at No. 8.</p><p>The offense wasn't bad last season, as they averaged 22.5 points per game (16th) and 124 rushing yards (10th). Defensively, they struggled, ranking last in yards per game allowed (402ypg), 31st against the pass (282ypg) and 24th against the run (120ypg). So while they could be drafting offense with the first pick, they also need some major help on defense.</p><p>They did pick up OLB Devon Kennard from Detroit, who had 7.0 sacks last season. LB De'Vondre Campbell comes over from Atlanta after recording 129 tackles last season and three forced fumbles, but is a liability in coverage. The pass rush was good last season thanks to OLB Chandler Jones (19 sacks), yet they still ranked just 17th with 2.5 sacks per game.</p><p>With a decent pass rush and Jones wreaking havoc, the biggest issue had to be the secondary. It starts at cornerback where the Cards allowed a league-high 109.9 passer rating last season. Cornerback Patrick Peterson struggled after coming back from a PED suspension and turns 30 this year. Kevin Peterson had shoulder issues and Byron Murphy had many issues to be kind.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Rams:</strong></p><p>2019: 9-7</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 33-1</p><p>First pick: 52nd and 54th overall</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: DT A'Shawn Robinson (Lions), OLB Leonard Floyd (Bears), OG Austin Blythe (Rams).</p><p>Key Losses: RB Todd Gurley (Rams), WR Brandin Cooks (Trade Texans), DE Dante Fowler Jr. (Falcons), LB Cory Littleton (Raiders), CB Nickell Robey-Coleman (Eagles), S Eric Weddle (retired), K Greg Zuerlein (Cowboys).</p><p>Needs: LB, Edge, CB, WR, G, OT, RB</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The Rams traded their first-round pick last October for star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. So they don't have a first-rounder, but they do have two second-rounders thanks to dealing Brandin Cooks to Houston on April 9 for the 54th pick. They gave up a fourth-rounder in 2022. They'll have to replace Cooks, but now they have more cap room and will win up with at least one rookie receiver.</p><p>The passing game should still be fine with Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods still around. What they need is offensive line help, especially to improve a running game that produced just 94 yards (26th) per carry. Todd Gurley is now gone, which means the job could be shared by Malcolm Brown, who had 255 yards last season and second-year back Darrell Henderson. The Rams could still use a back, but don't expect them to take one in the second round unless a Jonathan Taylor or D'Andre Swift are available.</p><p>The biggest need on offense is the line. Jared Goff didn't have enough time to throw even a screen pass as the Rams' running backs combined for just 260 yards receiving, which was the lowest total in the NFL. LT Andrew Whitworth is now 38 and is finally showing a decline. So drafting his replacement is key and they could select one in the second round. They could also draft a guard as last year's rookies Joseph Noteboom and Brian Allen struggled.</p><p>Defensively, the Rams were decent last season, allowing 23 points per game (17th) and 340 yards per game (13th). They had a strong pass rush, ranking fourth with 3.1 sacks per game. But they lost Dante Fowler (11.5 sacks) in free agency. They haven't replaced him yet so drafting an Edge rusher in the second round with one of their picks is likely. They did bring in 27-yard old OLB Leonard Floyd, who started for the Bears last season, but had just three sacks and has never lived up to his potential in four seasons since being taken ninth overall in 2016.</p><p>They are solid up front on defensive line after re-signing Michael Brockers (after he nearly signed with the Ravens) and also picked up big DT A'Shawn Robinson (6-4, 330), as a nose guard to replace Sebastian Joseph-Day, who struggled alongside Aaron Donald and Brockers.</p><p><strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p>2019: 13-3</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider):</p><p>First pick: No. 13, 31</p><p>Key Free Agent pickups and trades: WR Travis Benjamin (Chargers).</p><p>Key Losses: WR Emmanuel Sanders (Saints), TE Garrett Celek (retired), TE Levine Toiolo (Giants), DT DeForest Buckner (Trade Colts).</p><p>Needs: CB, WR, DL, G, OT, LB</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>The 49ers made the Super Bowl last season and didn't have many losses aside from trading Pro Bowl DT DeForest Buckner to the Colts for their 13th overall pick. GM John Lynch must have something up his sleeves because it's tough to develop a dominant defensive tackle. They may find one at 13 or 31, but he won't be as effective as Buckner right away. Ross Blacklock from TCU could be a value pick at 31 or they could take Javon Kinlaw from South Carolina if he falls to 13.</p><p>At wide receiver, the 49ers lost Emmanuel Sanders in free agency and could use some help for Jimmy Garoppolo. Deebo Samuel looks like an absolute stud and was a great pick in the second round. This was a run-heavy team that averaged 144 yards per game (2nd) on the ground and a pedestrian 237 yards per game in the air (13th). Adding a burner like a Henry Ruggs III at 13 would make a lot of sense to pair with Samuel. They also picked up Travis Benjamin, a journeyman receiver from the Chargers, who could fit in as a slot receiver.</p><p>The 49ers also have to look to the future of their offensive line. Left tackle Joe Staley missed nine games last season due to injuries and is 36. Justin Skule struggled as a rookie last season taking his place. Ultimately, he probably is not the answer to replace Staley, so finding a replacement in the draft is key.</p><p>At cornerback, San Francisco is fine for now. But next season, all four corners will be free agents. Richard Sherman is also not getting any younger at 32, though he does not rely on his physical skills. He's one of the smartest defensive backs in the game.</p><p><strong>Seattle Seahawks</strong>:</p><p>2019: 11-5</p><p>Super Bowl Odds (via Vegas Insider): 20-1</p><p>First pick: No. 27</p><p>Key Free agent pickups and trades: WR Phillip Dorsett (Patriots), Edge Edge Bruce Irvin (Panthers), CB Quinton Dunbar (Trade Redskins), TE Greg Olsen (Panthers), OT Cedric Ogbuehi (Jaguars), C B.J. Finney (Steelers).</p><p>Key Losses: OT George Fant (Jets), OL Germain Ifedi (Bears), DT Al Woods (Jaguars), DE Quinton Jefferson (Bills).</p><p>Needs: LB, Edge, CB, OT, OG</p><p>Outlook:</p><p>As long as the Seahawks have Russell Wilson, they will be fine. They gave Wilson a few more weapons in the offseason, including Phillip Dorsett, who played with the Patriots the last three seasons. They also added veteran Greg Olsen, who just turned 35. He was still effective last season with Carolina, catching 52 passes for 597 yards in 14 games. but Olsen hasn't played a full season since 2016, when he was one of the best in the game. They could lose Luke Wilson in free agency and Will Dissly has had trouble staying healthy over his last two seasons.</p><p>At offensive tackle, Duane Brown is fine at left tackle, but he is 35 and has an injury history. Wilson was sacked on 8.5 percent of his dropbacks in 2019. They did lose No. 3 OT George Fant to the Jets in free agency. They also lost right tackle Germain Ifedi to the Bears in free agency. Adding an offensive tackle is an option at No. 27 in the first round. Austin Jackson from USC appears to be a good value at that spot.</p><p>They also have to improve the interior of the offensive line. Mike Iupati and D.J. Fluker were both selected in the first rounds, but they have performed that well. Iupati also might leave in free agency.</p><p>Defensively, the Seahawks could use some help in the pass rush. Jadeveon Clowney is expected to leave in free agency, though he hasn't signed with any team as of April 10. Even with Clowney, the Seahawks had just 28 sacks, which ranked 31st in the NFL. The addition of Bruce Irvin will help some. He had 8.5 sacks last season in a rotation role at outside linebacker.</p><p>At 27, they could go defensive end or outside linebacker considering Clowney and Mychael Kendricks are expected to be gone. The Seahawks allowed 118 yards per game on the ground (22nd) and 264 yards per game in the air (27th). So focusing on defense is a strong possibility. At cornerback, Shaquill Griffin looks like the real deal, but they can use a second starting corner. Tre Flowers has been picked on a lot and is also prone to pass interference penalties.</p>
