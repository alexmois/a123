                        <p>We have an upper bracket final of the DreamHack Masters Spring 2020: North America upcoming between FURIA and 100 Thieves, and there's a trip to the Grand Final on the line. This should be a super exciting contest between two of the best not only in the North American region of CS:GO, but in the world. FURIA opens as a somewhat small favorite, and they are going to have to bring it in order to take down 100 Thieves.</p><p><h3>FURIA Preview</h3></p><p><strong>HLTV World Ranking: 8th</strong></p><p>The Brazilian powerhouse of FURIA has established themselves as one of the long-running best teams in the world. They were able to walk through the Group A portion of this event with relative ease. They blanked Brazilian rival MiBR 2-0 before beating Team Liquid and then Chaos by a score of 2-1. FURIA has been completely solid with a 77.3% win rate over the last three months. Much of this success can be attributed to the fact that Nuke is the only map the team struggles with. In fact, Nuke is the only map in which FURIA has a win rate lower than 60% on in the last three months.</p><p>Whether it's HEN1, yuurih or KSCERATO, what makes FURIA so special is they have three "anchors" if you will on their roster. The aforementioned trio has been superb the last three months with an average of 2.23 kills per round while only dying 1.72 times a round. VINI and arT are not nearly as dominant as their counterparts, but they do a great job in team play and aren't nearly as bad as the bottom of other teams' rosters. FURIA can make quick work in this contest, they just have to be careful. 100 Thieves is no pushover by any means and perhaps match up better with FURIA than anyone else. So long as FURIA doesn't try to push the issue, they shouldn't have many problems in this battle.</p><p><h3>100 Thieves Preview</h3></p><p><strong>HLTV World Ranking: 11th</strong></p><p>The Australian, battle-tested squad of 100 Thieves didn't have quite as easy of a path into the playoffs, but they made it. They were able to take down Gen.G easily 2-0 followed by a 2-0 win over Cloud9 as well. 100 Thieves ran into a very familiar opponent in Evil Geniuses in their closing match, however, and fell flat with a 1-2 loss. 100 Thieves has only won 47.4% of their matches over the last three months, which is unsual for them. Their map pool also hasn't been nearly as strong with win rates below 50% on the maps Inferno, Mirage and Nuke over this same period.</p><p>100 Thieves has a veteran roster, and although they haven't looked as dominant as in the past lately, they can still knock off any team. Much of the team's success lies behind the driving force of the trio of Gratisfaction, jkaem and jks. These three have been better than the average over the last three months with an average of 2.15 kills per round while being killed 1.93 times a round. This difference may seem miniscule on a lower scale, but a positive kill to death ratio will churn out success more often than not. 100 Thieves, like their opponent, don't have any players that are overly hindering which has helped them out from time to time. For 100 Thieves to pull an upset, they will need to play well as a team, something they've struggled to do from time to time.</p><p><h3>Pick: FURIA ML (-155 @ Bovada)</h3></p><p>This play is a little costly on the juice, but I definitely feel as though it's the most safe play. I'm not totally ready to completely write off 100 Thieves, but as we've seen, they can struggle against tougher teams recently (example - the Evil Geniuses loss). FURIA is playing on a whole other level than many teams in the world, and their 77.3% win rate over the last three months proves just this. 100 Thieves could very well win one of these maps, but they won't win the entire series. FURIA is simply too good of a team, and given their current form, I don't see any way they lose this battle.</p>
