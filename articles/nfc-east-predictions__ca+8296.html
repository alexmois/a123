The NFC East was intensely competitive, as it was the only division to not have a team with a losing record last season. The Eagles, Cowboys and Giants all made the playoffs. Will the division have similar success this season? Check below for my predictions:</p><p><h3 dir="ltr">Philadelphia Eagles: Under 11.5 wins (-115)</h3></p><p>The Eagles caught the league by surprise last season, as Jalen Hurts helped to carry his team to the Super Bowl. They did not win the Super Bowl, but there will be a hangover in Philadelphia, as this team will not come close to winning 14 games again. They are playing a first-place schedule, with non-divisional games against the Chiefs, 49ers, Bills and Jets. The league has now had an entire off-season to learn how to stop their short yardage rugby scrum play, and its efficiency will start to dwindle. Hurts upped his completion percentage, yards, passing and rushing touchdowns and decreased his interceptions from the previous season. This type of growth will not happen again and the Eagles will take a small step back this season.</p><p>Need a boost to your bankroll?

Dak Prescott has missed significant time in two of the past three years due to injury, if he stays healthy Dallas has plenty of weapons to be a top-tier offense. Tony Pollard will finally be given to opportunity to be the lead back in Dallas, even though most insiders knew he was better than Ezekial Elliott over the past two seasons. Ceedee Lamb and Michael Gallup will mature and grow with a year of continuity, and the addition of Brandin Cooks provides another quick receiver for Prescott to dump it off to. Micah Parsons is in his prime and may be the best defensive player in the league. The Cowboys have the Giants, Cardinals and Patriots in three of their first four games, so they should easily start 3-1 on the way to hitting this season over.</p><p><h3 dir="ltr"></h3></p><p><h3 dir="ltr">New York Giants: Over 7.5 wins (+100)</h3></p><p>All of the offseason news was about Saquon Barkley, his contract, and the disrespect shown to the running back position. The overload of negative press paints the picture of a disappointing season to come, but I believe the value is on the over. Barkley got his contract, he is going to play. Daniel Jones does not need to be an elite QB for this team to get wins. Brian Daboll proved he can design an offense that doesn&rsquo;t ask too much of Jones while still producing points. Jones finished as a top 10 QB in fantasy scoring due to his running ability, and the Giants added Cole Beasley and Darren Waller as two short-yardage weapons, the Giants will be able to move the chains. Take their over.</p><p><h3 dir="ltr">Washington Commanders: Under 6.5 wins (-120)</h3></p><p>The Commanders used up all their luck last season. They had the best record out of any team who finished last in their division. This will not happen again, except for the part about finishing last in their division. Sam Howell only threw 19 passes last season, but is now expected to lead this offense with a brand new offensive coordinator. There have already been rumblings that the players are not getting along with OC Eric Bieniemy due to his intense coaching style. Chase Young has not been able to prove he is still an elite pass rusher after tearing his ACL two years ago. This division is too tough, and I do not trust Sam Howell to go out and win many one-score games. Washington will be in the basement of the division, with less than six wins.</p><p><h3 dir="ltr"></h3></p><p><h3 dir="ltr">Division Winner: Dallas Cowboys (+190)</h3></p><p>Great value here for a strong roster. In what is likely a two-team race, I&rsquo;ll give the edge to the Cowboys. They welcome in a new offensive coordinator in Brian Schottenheimer, who has already received praise from Dak Prescott. Micah Parsons leads a strong defensive unit with Trevon Diggs, Demarcus Lawrence, and Stephon Gilmore. Zach Martin and Tyron Smith anchor a strong offensive line that will keep Prescott on his feet. If Prescott stays healthy, Dallas is a great bet to dethrone the Eagles.</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-b689bde8-7fff-a1a8-35da-d4ca63586bbb"></strong></p><p>Need a boost to your bankroll?
