                        <p>2023 NFL Training Camp Preview</p><p>The NFL is set to get underway with the first exhibition game on Thursday, Aug. 3 with the New York Jets facing Cleveland in Canton, Ohio in the Hall of Fame Game. Most teams will get underway on August 10 with Week 1 of the preseason to get ready for the regular season. Training camps begin as early as July 19 so let&rsquo;s take a look at all 32 teams and their questions for the upcoming season.</p><p><strong><em>(<a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/1">Ben Hayes</a> was 5-0 over his last five before the All-Star Break. Check out his discounted prices on his Best Bets, Weekly, Monthly and Second Half specials).</em></strong></p><p>(odds from Draft Kings)</p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +20000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Glendale, Ariz. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key questions: With DeAndre Hopkins gone in free agency, which wide receiver will step up? They really don&rsquo;t have a number-one receiver, but Marquise Brown and Rondale Moore are quick burners. QB Kyler Murray is also returning from a torn ACL suffered in Week 14, so he probably won&rsquo;t be ready for the opening of the season. That means a lot of Colt McCoy though preseason will see a lot of Clayton Tune, a rookie from Houston. The defense is a work in progress with J.J. Watt retired, but at least FS Budda Baker is back. This is a squad that is stuck in neutral.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Falcons:</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Flowery Branch Ga. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Desmond Ridder takes over at quarterback and he&rsquo;s the biggest question on the team. It was tough to judge Ridder, because he lost his best weapon in TE Kyle Pitts, who was slowed by an MCL injury. Rookie RB Bijan Robinson will be asked to step in right away though Tyler Allgeier is in the mix. Second-year WR Drake London will need to show more consistency. Defensively, they added some nice pieces and Eddie Goldman is back from retirement along with Calais Campbell and David Onyemata to improve the defensive line, though Campbell is 30.</p><p><strong>Baltimore Ravens:</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +2000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Owings Mills, Md.</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Lamar Jackson is back with a new contract and has a new OC in Todd Monken. His performance in camp with a new offense and some new weapons at wide receiver led by Odell Beckham Jr. is key considering he probably won&rsquo;t play in preseason. There are some depth questions on the defensive line with Calais Campbell gone to Atlanta in free agency. Nose guard Michael Pierce returns from injury and is now 30. The cornerbacks outside of Marlon Humphrey and Rock Ya-Sin.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bills:</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +900</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Rochester, N.Y.</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Buffalo is one of the most complete teams in the NFL. The Stefon Diggs drama might be the only concern on offense. James Cook takes over at running back for Devin Singletary, who moves on in free agency. The offensive line needed to get bigger and tougher. They added Connor McGovern, a big left guard from the Jets and drafted 330-pound O&rsquo;Cyrus Torrence in the second round.</p><p><strong>Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +7000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Spartanburg, S.C. (Wofford College)</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 22</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Frank Reich takes over a team that will likely start rookie Bryce Young at quarterback, whom they traded up to get at No. 1. But to move up, they dealt top WR D.J. Moore away to Chicago. That leaves 33-year-old Adam Thielen and D.J. Chark, who has just 37 catches since 2021 due to injuries. The defense moves from a 4-3 to a 3-4 with Brian Burns moving from defensive end to outside linebacker. He&rsquo;s also in a contract year and they might be able to get something substantial for him before the trade deadline.</p><p><strong>Chicago Bears</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +5000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Lake Forest, Ill.</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 22</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The Bears added WR D.J. Moore, so that puts pressure on QB Justin Fields to continue to improve as a passer. Moore will help with that progression and the addition of TE Robert Tonyan to pair with Cole Kmet should make life easier. Now, if WR Chase Claypool can find his footing in Chicago, they could be a surprise in the NFC North. After trading away Roquan Smith, the Bears needed an upgrade at linebacker and signed Tremaine Edmunds and T.J. Edwards. The bigger question is at pass rusher where the Bears recorded just 20 sacks last season to finish last in the league.</p><p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +1100</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Cincinnati (Paycor Stadium)</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 22</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Cincy&rsquo;s offense is loaded with weapons and they added a quality left tackle in Orlando Brown Jr. from Kansas City. There will be more of a question at right tackle where La&rsquo;El Collins is coming off major knee surgery. Defensively, they have to replace top safeties in Jessie Bates and Vonn Bell. Dax Hill, Cam Taylor-Britt and rookie Jordan Battle are in the mix. First-round pick Myles Murphy was drafted in the first round to help generate some much-needed pass rush.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +4000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Berea, Ohio</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 19</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 21</strong></p><p>Key Questions: It starts with Deshaun Watson and whether he can get back to his early Houston years before he sat out the last year-and-a-half due to a violation of the NFL&rsquo;s personal conduct policy. Nick Chubb needs a backup with Kareem Hunt gone. Jordan Ford will get the opportunity. At linebacker, Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah had an injury-plagued season and will need to get stronger to be a full-time player. Linebacker will be the biggest concern on defense this season with Jacob Phillips returning from a torn pec.</p><p><strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +1400 </strong></p><p><strong>Location: Oxnard, Calif. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Dallas will attempt to catch the Eagles in the NFL East. Mike McCarthy needs to win something this season or he will be out. DC Dan Quinn needs to shore up the run defense, which ranked 22nd last season. They hope that drafting Mazi Smith as the first defensive tackle they&rsquo;ve taken in the first round since 1992, will help. Micah Parsons is expected to move to defensive end, though that has been disputed. Parson has put on weight to get to around 255 just in case.</p><p><strong>Denver Broncos: </strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds:</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Englewood, Colo.</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 19</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: It starts with Russell Wilson and ends with Sean Payton. Payton brings in new DC Vance Joseph, which will mean a lot more blitzing. But if Wilson doesn&rsquo;t get back to his Pro Bowl form from Seattle, then there&rsquo;s only so much they can do. Wilson had just 12 passing TDs in his final 13 starts. Jarrett Stidham is an interesting backup, who could end up starting if he has a strong camp and Wilson falters in the first half of the season.</p><p><strong>Detroit Lions</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +2200</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Allen Park, Mich.</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 19</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 22</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The Lions are on the upward trends but you have to wonder when will Jared Goff turn back to a mediocre quarterback. Rookie third-round pick Hendon Hooker is coming off a torn ACL, so Goff doesn&rsquo;t have to look over his shoulder since Hooker won&rsquo;t be ready for at least half the season. Goff has thrown 324 straight passes without an INT. At running back, they have to replace Jamaal Williams and D&rsquo;Andre Swift. David Montgomery and rookie Jahmyr Gibbs will battle it out for playing time.</p><p><strong>Green Bay Packers</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Green Bay</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 21</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Where does it start? How about at quarterback where Jordan Love takes over for Aaron Rodgers, who was moved to the Jets in the offseason. All eyes will be on the young quarterback and coach Matt LaFleur&rsquo;s offense, because Rodgers would often change plays at the line. As usual, Green Bay needs some wide receiver to step up. Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs showed promise as a rookie last season. They finally used the draft to help out, adding Jayden Reed in the season round along with Dontayvion Wicks in the fifth. They are also many question marks on defense despite the fact that they&rsquo;ve used 12 of their last 13 first-round picks on that side of the ball.</p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Houston Texans</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Super Bowl Odds: +20000</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Location: Houston</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Rookie Report Date: July 25</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Veteran Report Date: July 25</h5></p><p>Key Questions: Another team with quarterback questions. Houston will need to be patient with rookie QB C.J. Stroud and unless he&rsquo;s spectacular in camp, Davis Mills or Case Keenum will start, which means another long season. But it also means a high draft pick and if they don&rsquo;t want to use that on a quarterback, they could get quite the haul in the draft for a trade. DeMeco Ryans takes over as head coach and he will have his work cut out for him. Adding Will Anderson Jr. to set the edge up front is a start.</p><p><strong>Indianapolis Colts</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +10000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Westfield, Ind. (Grand Park)</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Another rough season for the Colts is coming back with new coach Shane Steichen coming from Philadelphia to take over as head coach for Frank Reich. Rookie QB Anthony Richardson might be given the keys to the offense right away and they should rely on the run with a healthy Jonathan Taylor and Richardson&rsquo;s ability to move. Defensively, they need help with a pass rush after losing Yannick Ngakoue and his 9.5 sacks.</p><p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +2500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Jacksonville</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 21</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: With the Colts, Texans and Titans having major issues, it&rsquo;s time for the Jags to continue to get better. It starts on defense where they were terrible on third-down defense, ranking 29th. They also ranked 25th in allowing touchdowns in the red zone. The offense should be explosive again and Trevor Lawrence adds a new weapon in Calvin Ridley. It will be interesting to see whether Ridley has lost anything after sitting out last season.</p><p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +600 (the favorite)</strong></p><p><strong>Location: St. Joseph, Mo. (Missouri Western State)</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 22</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The Chiefs are trying to do one of the most difficult things in sports and that&rsquo;s to repeat. KC is about as sturdy as you can get but did lose Orlando Brown Jr. at left tackle. Former right tackle Jawaan Taylor and Donovan Smith will likely vie for the left tackle spot, but Smith is likely to man that spot. Rookie Wayna Morris and third-year tackle Lucas Niang are also in the mix at right tackle, if Taylor doesn&rsquo;t get the left tackle spot. The only other mystery is whether Chris Jones (15.5 sacks) gets an extension as he&rsquo;s entering the final year of his deal.</p><p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Henderson, Nev. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 20</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 2</strong>5</p><p>Key Questions: QB Derek Carr (Saints) and TE Darren Waller (Giants) have moved on. Jimmy Garoppolo was signed in the off-season to replace him. But Jimmy G., while a successful quarterback, has had issues staying healthy. In other words, rookie Aidan O&rsquo;Connell and veteran Brian Hoyer better be ready in camp just in case. They need CB Nate Hobbs to return to his rookie form. He struggled with a hand injury and a new defense last season. At tight end, rookie Michael Mayer will have a chance to play right away with Waller gone.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Chargers</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +2500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Costa Mesa, Calif. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 2</strong>5</p><p>Key Questions: The Chargers are always the bridesmaid and never the bride. At this point, they are getting close to getting to the big game, but they need to get past the Chiefs in the AFC West. New OC Kellen Moore should improve their offense when it comes to getting more chunk plays. Having a healthy Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, who played sparingly together in the first 10 games, would help. The secondary gets a boost from J.C. Jackson, who suffered a knee injury last season and he could be a big difference. They also need to play better up front where they allowed 145.8 rushing yards per game (28th). Health was also a concern last season with Austin Johnson (6-4, 314) playing just eight games due to injury.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Rams</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Irvine, Calif. (UC Irvine)</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Will he stay or will he go? Apparently, Sean McVay is in for the long haul, but who knows if his team goes 5-12 again? The key is the health of Matthew Stafford as the Rams had very little behind him last season when he played in just nine games due to an elbow injury and spinal cord contusion. They also missed star WR Cooper Kupp over the last eight games due to an ankle injury. RB Cam Akers appears to be the top back in a crowded room with Darrell Henderson and Kyren Williams around. The defense will be much younger with Jalen Ramsey, Leonard Floyd and Bobby Wagner gone. It will be interesting to see who emerges around Aaron Donald.</p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Miami Dolphins</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Super Bowl Odds: +2500</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Location: Miami Garden, Fla.</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Rookie Report Date: July 18</h5></p><p><h5 class="MsoNormal">Veteran Report Date: July 25</h5></p><p>Key Questions: The key for the Dolphins is keeping Tua Tagovailoa healthy, so it starts on the offensive line. He also needs to get rid of the football quicker as he was knocked down 27 times in 13 games last season. On defense, they bring in Vic Fangio as the coordinator and he has a lot to work with Jalen Ramsey and his ego is now playing with Xavien Howard in the secondary. Howard is now 30 and could be slowing down. S Brandon Jones missed 11 games after knee surgery, so they need him to be healthy to team with Jevon Holland. Other than that, the potential is to be an elite defense under Fangio, but statistically, they were anything but that last season.</p><p><strong>Minnesota Vikings</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +3500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Eagan, Minn. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 23</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Aaron Rodgers is gone from Green Bay so that opens it up in the NFC North. Dalvin Cook is gone so the running game will be focused on Alexander Mattison, who will need some help. QB Kirk Cousins is due to be a free agent next season and they&rsquo;ll need him to get to that next level or it&rsquo;s time for a change. The fact that rookie WR Jordan Addison has arrived to help out superstar Justin Jefferson and company will be key with Adam Thielen gone. On defense, Brian Flores will try to improve a defense that was awful last season and has many questions in the secondary.</p><p><strong>New England Patriots</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Foxborough, Mass. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 21</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: This is Mac Jones' team which can be a good or bad thing unless Bill Belichick hypes another quarterback behind him like Bailey Zappe. Jones had a rough season, but the Pats added JuJu Smith-Schuster, which should help as a big receiver who can run after the catch. The tight end room should improve with Mike Gesicki helping out Hunter Henry. The defense was solid as ever last season, but they lost Devin McCourty, who retired after 13 seasons. Jalen Mills will move from cornerback to safety and could end up taking McCourty&rsquo;s place, but that&rsquo;s a big question mark.</p><p><strong>New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +4000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Metairie, La. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Derek Carr moves from the Raiders to the Saints. He&rsquo;ll be the best quarterback since Drew Brees and should elevate the offense. However, Carr struggled last season and he could be on the downward trend at 32. Alvin Kamar could also get a suspension at some point for a February 2022 incident where he has to pay more than $100,000 to the victim for medical expenses. They did get touchdown machine Jamaal Williams and have a third-rounder in Kendre Miller, who has a similar skill set to Kamara. Former QB/TE/RB Tayson Hill is now trying to become a receiver at 33, because why not? He is still fast and elusive, but that&rsquo;s a tough task at that age. Michael Thomas, at 30 and the 2019 AP Offensive Player of the Year, is hoping to return to health and with Carr around, he will get the ball some.</p><p><strong>New York Giants</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: East Rutherford, N.J. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Brian Daboll did a great job in his first season at the helm, as the Giants went 10-8-1. But there are questions everywhere, starting at running back, where Saquon Barkley wants a new deal and doesn&rsquo;t want to play under the franchise tag. Daniel Jones did get the big contract, but will look for more explosive plays as New York recorded just 28 of 20-plus yards to rank last in the league. The addition of tight end Darren Waller should help the passing game immensely. On defense, the pass rush was average as they recorded 41 sacks (13th) and the run defense was awful (27th). They need somebody to step on the Edge.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>New York Jets</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +1800</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Florham Park, N.J. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 19</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 19</strong></p><p>Key Questions: So, there&rsquo;s a guy named Aaron Rodgers and he&rsquo;s coming to town to attempt to do what &ldquo;Broadway&rdquo; Joe Namath did and that&rsquo;s win a Super Bowl for the first time for the Jets in 54 years. Rodgers will need a strong offensive line in front of him, because, at 39, he doesn&rsquo;t move as well as he used to. Mekhi Becton and Duane Brown are capable tackles, but need to stay healthy. RB Breece Hall is also coming off a serious knee injury and that means he might not be back to his pre-injury form yet. The pass defense is scary good, but they will need to shore up the run defense some.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +650</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Philadelphia</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The Eagles are attempting to not be the team that suffers the Super Bowl hangover. Only eight teams have returned to the Super Bowl the year after losing it. Fortunately, the Eagles play in the NFC and it starts with avoiding injuries or at least key injuries. Jalen Hurts ran 165 times last season and that could be an issue if he keeps that up. The addition of D&rsquo;Andre Swift will give him a target in the backfield and take some pressure off his running ability. New DC Sean Desai will have a similar philosophy to Jonathan Gannon, but there could be some slight alterations. When you rank second overall in defense, you don&rsquo;t need to make huge changes.</p><p><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +5000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Latrobe, Pa. (Saint Vincent College)</strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 26</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 26</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The Steelers ranked 14th last year in sacks after leading the league from 2018-22 and that was due to an injury to T.J. Watt. That number should return or at least get close to the top. The key is at quarterback where Kenny Pickett started 12 games as a rookie and led the Steelers to a 5-2 record over the last seven games. Can he continue to improve and lead the Steelers over the Bengals and Ravens in the AFC North? Pittsburgh averaged just 18.1 points per game last season so OC Matt Canada will need a stronger season to keep his job.</p><p><strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +1000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Santa Clara, Calif. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 18</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The big question here is whether Brock Purdy will be ready for the regular season. He went 7-1 as a starter, but then tore a UCL and is rehabbing his elbow. The 49ers added Sam Darnold and still have former No. 3 pick Trey Lance on the roster. If Purdy is healthy, he&rsquo;s the starter. If not, there will be a competition between Darnold and Lance. The defense should as strong as ever, but Steve Wilks takes over for DeMeco Ryans, who left for Houston. Javon Hargrave arrives from the Eagles after recording a career-high 11 sacks. New Kicker Jake Moody was taken in the third round and will have a lot of pressure on him to replace Robbie Gould.</p><p><strong>Seattle Seahawks</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +3000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Renton, Wash. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: At running back, Rashaad Penny left for the Eagles. Kenneth Walker III had an excellent rookie season, but could be pushed by rookie Zach Charbonnet from UCLA. Charbonnet led FBS with 168 all-purpose yards per game in 2022. The key is the defense, which ranked 25th in scoring defense and 30th against the run. Bobby Wagner is back with the Seahawks after spending a year with the Rams. Rookie Devon Witherspoon will look to strengthen the secondary and a defense that added a bunch of players due to the Russell Wilson trade.</p><p><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +8000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Tampa Fla. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 24</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: The good news is that the NFC South stinks, so making the playoffs won&rsquo;t be that difficult. The bad news is that the Bucs don&rsquo;t have a solid starting quarterback. Baker Mayfield is on his fourth team already and will likely start. Kyle Trask has thrown just nine NFL passes to OC Dave Canales has his work cut out for him. Canales did a great job in Seattle with Geno Smith. The offensive line will need to improve, especially in the running game (32nd overall). Getting a healthy C Ryan Jensen back will help and rookie Cody Mauch will likely start at guard. They&rsquo;ll also have competition at the other guard and Luke Goedeke is expected to move to right tackle.</p><p><strong>Tennessee Titans</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +8000</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Nashville </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 22</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: New OC Tim Kelly takes over an offense that was dreadful last season, especially the 30th-ranked passing game. Rookie Will Levis is the future at quarterback as it appears the Titans have already given up on Malik Willis. This will likely be Ryan Tannehill&rsquo;s last season as the starter as he and RB Derrick Henry are in the final year of their respective contracts. Defensively, Tennessee was atrocious against the pass (32nd) partially due to injuries that rocked the secondary. They also get back linebacker Harold Landry III, who tore his ACL before the start of last season.</p><p><strong>Washington Commanders</strong></p><p><strong>Super Bowl Odds: +6500</strong></p><p><strong>Location: Ashburn, Va. </strong></p><p><strong>Rookie Report Date: July 21</strong></p><p><strong>Veteran Report Date: July 25</strong></p><p>Key Questions: Washington has their work cut out in one of the toughest divisions in football. Sam Howell and Jacoby Brissett will battle it out at quarterback, though the second-year pro from North Carolina is the likely starter. He certainly has enough weapons led by Terry McLaurin. They&rsquo;ll be as good as their offensive line, which was shaky last season to be nice. Their defense was very good last season, ranking third overall in yardage allowed. They could be even better if DE Chase Young can live up to his potential.</p>
