                        <p><h3>Winning Willie's NFL Mock Draft</h3></p><p>With the NFL draft right around the corner, there's still a ton of uncertainty ahead. All eyes have been on the quarterback class, but we can't forget about the other positions either. Which team will find the next late round sleeper? Who will shock the world on "virtual" draft night? These questions and more will be answered within the next week.</p><p>*Be sure to check out Ben the Pen's mock draft as well <a href="nfl-mock-draft-part-ii-first-and-second-rounds__ca+139.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>*</p><p><h5>1) Cincinnati Bengals - Joe Burrow, QB LSU</h5></p><p>This is the most obvious selection upcoming. Burrow is coming off an incredible national championship run last season. The defending Heisman winner will most certainly find a new home in Cincinnati. I do wonder if his outstanding campaign was just a fluke, but that will remain to be seen. Either way, expect Burrow to be the number one overall pick this year as he will be leading the charge for the Bengals this upcoming season.</p><p><h5>2) Washington Redskins -QB Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama</h5></p><p>Assuming that Washington doesn't trade away this pick, I expect them to whiff on the Chase Young train significantly. Let's face it, Dwayne Haskins is nothing spectacular. He had no business being drafted 15th last year. I believe that the Redskins will elect to go with a more promising option at quarterback, and that will be the southpaw gunslinger from Alabama. Tagovailoa may be coming off an injury, but he's been medically cleared to play and he's always seemed like a raw talent. His precision passing, especially on the deep throws, will be highly sought after and Tua to Scary Terry will indeed be a scary threat.</p><p><h5>3) Detroit Lions - DE/EDGE Chase Young, Ohio State</h5></p><p>The Lions are in a weird spot here. They need a better offensive line, but it's going to be impossible for them to pass up the opportunity to snag Chase Young. Detroit is expected to target a defensive player with this pick, and Young will add a nice threat to an already decent defensive front. He is a freakish talent who is an excellent pass rusher and will see long-term success in the NFL. Matt Patricia will be licking his chops after this wonderful addition to his team.</p><p><h5>4) New York Giants - OT Jedrick Wills, Alabama</h5></p><p>We've got to trust that GM Dave Gettleman won't completely mess this pick up like he's been known to do. The Giants need help on their offensive line in the worst way, and this is the perfect plug. Jedrick Wills is versatile and can line up at both tackle and guard. His game closely reminds me of a pick of Green Bay's in the second round last year, Elgton Jenkins, who had a great rookie season. Giants coach Joe Judge is a former Alabama assistant, and Nick Saban may influence this pick a little bit.</p><p><h5>5) Miami Dolphins - QB Justin Herbert, Oregon</h5></p><p>The Dolphins are going to get their quarterback situation figured out eventually. I believe that Justin Herbert could be a great fit for them if they can get him a good offensive line. Miami is definitely going quarterback here and Herbert is a good fit in my eyes. I personally believe that he's one of the best prospects on the board, if not THE best. He's a gunslinger who's not afraid to put the ball in the window that it needs to be in, and he is also a good pocket passer.</p><p><h5>6) Los Angeles Chargers - QB Jordan Love, Utah State</h5></p><p>This selection may be the big "shocker" if you will. The Chargers are one of many teams who have shown interest in Jordan Love, and he is arguably a better option under center than Tyrod Taylor. Granted, Love showed some regression from his junior year to his senior year. However, the Chargers need a quarterback and they have already beefed up their offensive line. I expect this pick to be very resemblant to the Daniel Jones selection in the sense that it will catch many people off guard.</p><p><h5>7) Carolina Panthers - LB Isaiah Simmons, Clemson</h5></p><p>He's officially listed as a linebacker, but Isaiah Simmons is one of the clear-cut ready NFL defensive prospects. He has taken snaps at four different positions, and he would be a perfect fit for this system. Carolina already needed any kind of help on the defensive side of things, and they need it even worse after Luke Kuechly retired. Simmons will step into a starting role and play a huge part for this Panthers defense next season as they search for a resurgence.</p><p><h5>8) Arizona Cardinals - OT Tristan Wirfs, Iowa</h5></p><p>Arizona had a glaring issue last season. Their offensive line needed help badly and they will address this problem nicely here. Tristan Wirfs is the perfect plug to the trenches for this team. Kliff Kingsbury and the Cardinals love to air the ball out and Wirfs is an excellent pass blocker. He put together a nice showing at the combine and he's also versatile on the line. Wirfs took snaps at both tackle positions as well as guard. Look for him to land in Arizona and seek to give Kyler Murray some much-needed aid.</p><p><h5>9) Jacksonville Jaguars - CB Jeff Okudah, Ohio State</h5></p><p>No one really knows what position will be top on the agenda for Jacksonville, but it's obvious that they have a lot of holes. I expect them to jump on the opportunity to snag an incredible cornerback in Jeff Okudah. He's a bigger sized corner, but he has the speed and athleticism to hang with anyone. Okudah has drawn a lot of comparison to Jalen Ramsey, and it's only fitting that he will take over the role that was once his.</p><p><h5>10) Cleveland Browns - OT Mekhi Becton, Louisville</h5></p><p>Cleveland had another offseason with improvements, but they are still lacking one more solid anchor at tackle on their offensive line. Mekhi Becton is an absolute beast in the trenches and he will be a solid final piece to this line. Becton did have a combine drug test flagged. However he has never failed a drug test previously and who are we kidding, NFL teams have a history for looking past these types of things. Becton will fit nicely into the Browns team that should be primed for a nice season.</p><p><h5>11) New York Jets - WR CeeDee Lamb, Oklahoma</h5></p><p>The Jets lost Robby Anderson this offseason, and although they did pick up Breshad Perriman, they are still in need of another solid wideout. CeeDee Lamb is a great fit for any offense and he's the clear-cut number one wide receiver in my eyes. Lamb has two key things going for him, and those are his speed and explosiveness. Sam Darnold needs a great down the field receiver, and this is the perfect addition for that.</p><p><h5>12) Las Vegas Raiders - WR Jerry Jeudy, Alabama</h5></p><p>It's obvious that the Raiders need a solid wide receiver. They're going to miss out on the quarterback pot, so I expect them to address their concerns at wideout here with Jerry Jeudy. I've seen a lot of boards projecting Jeudy's teammate Henry Ruggs III in this spot, but I believe that Jeudy is the more solid of the two. Ruggs has a slight speed advantage, but Jeudy is no slug in his own right and he's one of the best route runners available.</p><p><h5>13) San Francisco 49ers - DT Derrick Brown, Auburn</h5></p><p>San Francisco could stand to grab a wide receiver here, but I suspect that they will elect to address their need for an inside presence on the defensive line after losing DeForest Buckner this offseason. Derrick Brown is an absolute monster and was named SEC Defense Player of the Year coming from a stacked defensive class in the conference. Brown is quick enough to lineup on the edge, and I see him being a nice fit for the 49ers.</p><p><h5>14) Tampa Bay Buccaneers - OT Andrew Thomas, Georgia</h5></p><p>The addition of Tom Brady was huge for Tampa Bay this offseason, but it will all be for nothing if they don't beef their offensive line. Andrew Thomas coming off the board here makes sense. He'll be the best available offensive lineman and he's a big and beefy, ready to roll prospect. Thomas not only has the size, but he has a great football IQ as well and the Buccaneers will be happy to have him.</p><p><h5>15) Denver Broncos - CB C.J. Henderson, Florida</h5></p><p>The Broncos lost a huge piece of their defense in cornerback Chris Harris, and I look for them to replace him with their first-round pick. C.J. Henderson is a stud who I believe could find himself in a pro-bowl within his first few seasons. He does struggle to make some open field tackles, but that is an issue that can be addressed once he arrives in Denver. Henderson has the quickness and hands to have long-term success in the league.</p><p><h5>16) Atlanta Falcons - S/CB Xavier McKinney, Alabama</h5></p><p>Atlanta is one of the few teams who, on paper, don't appear to be needing to fill many voids. Their secondary could stand for a boost, however, and Xavier McKinney is the perfect fit for this. He's one of the more rare prospects available in the secondary as he is a safety by trade but can also line up as a cornerback. I believe that his versatility will be appealing enough for him to be taken here by the Falcons.</p><p><h5>17) Dallas Cowboys - CB Kristian Fulton, LSU</h5></p><p>We're never 100 percent sure what's going on in Jerry Jones's head, but I believe he will go defense here. The Cowboys lost their anchor cornerback Byron Jones to free agency, and they need to address this loss first and foremost. Kristian Fulton is a solid, shutdown corner who played a big part in LSU's national championship run. He found himself in some trouble early in his college career, but if he can avoid more trouble he will pan out nicely in the NFL.</p><p><h5>18) Miami Dolphins - WR Henry Ruggs III, Alabama</h5></p><p>The Dolphins have a great opportunity in this draft with three first round picks. They will address their quarterback situation with their first pick, and I suspect they will pick him up their rookie gunslinger another target with this selection. I believe that Henry Ruggs III still needs a little fine-tuning, but he has the potential to be the next Tyreek Hill due to his explosive speed. He should provide Miami with a nice, down the field option in the passing game.</p><p><h5>19) Las Vegas Raiders - DT Javon Kinlaw, South Carolina</h5></p><p>Back to Jon Gruden and company, I see the Raiders going defense here with their second pick. Javon Kinlaw is a big dude and he will be a menace on the defensive line. He's coming off a first-team AP All-American selection as well as first-team All-SEC honors, and his stats don't do justice as to just how dominant he can be. The Raiders need a little bit more help and Kinlaw is the perfect fit to aid their defensive front.</p><p><h5>20) Jacksonville Jaguars - DE/EDGE K'Lavon Chaisson, LSU</h5></p><p>Dipping back into the circus that currently is Jacksonville, this is a great spot to pick up another defensive prospect. The Jaguars need a replacement after trading away Calais Campbell, and K'Lavon Chaisson could fit that role. He's not going to light it up in terms of sacks, but he has great speed off the edge and he is constantly in the backfield causing problems for his opponents.</p><p><h5>21) Philadelphia Eagles - WR Denzel Mims, Baylor</h5></p><p>Somehow the Eagles are still in need of a receiver, and I like them to take Denzel Mims. He is ready to step into a top-receiver role and could fit in nicely with this system. Mims has said that Philadelphia showed the most interest in him throughout the pre-draft process, and they will love the opportunity to select him with this pick. He isn't the most consistent option at wideout, but his potential is too much to pass on.</p><p><h5>22) Minnesota Vikings - CB Trevon Diggs, Alabama</h5></p><p>This would be an interesting selection. Minnesota is in obvious need of help in their secondary, and Trevon Diggs would be a great addition to help. Interestingly enough, he is the younger brother of Stefon Diggs who the team traded away earlier in the offseason. I look for them pick up Diggs who had a great year with the Crimson Tide and will look to step in as the one or two cornerbacks for the team.</p><p><h5>23) New England Patriots - DE/OLB Yetur Gross-Matos, Penn State</h5></p><p>The Patriots have a lot of holes to fill for the first time in a while. They obviously have to address their quarterback situation at some point, but they need help with their linebackers and defensive line more. Yetur Gross-Matos is the perfect fit for coach Belichick. He's an explosive pass rusher who had 9.5 sacks last year. He can also play outside linebacker and his versatility should make a great impression on New England.</p><p><h5>24) New Orleans Saints - CB A.J. Terrell, Clemson</h5></p><p>The Saints made some great additions this offseason when they added a solid number two receiver in Emmanuel Sanders and safety Malcolm Jenkins. However, they still need some more help in the secondary. A.J. Terrell is one of the more quiet options available at cornerback, but he's a great pick up. He can step right in and make a difference for a New Orleans team that has always seemed to lack solid cornerback play.</p><p><h5>25) Minnesota Vikings - WR Justin Jefferson, LSU</h5></p><p>With the Vikings back on the clock, I look for them to add a receiver to replace Stefon Diggs with this pick. Justin Jefferson has been outshined in this class by a trio that is clearly ahead of the pack. However, he's a solid option who is also NFL-ready and will be ready to step into the number two wide receiver role in this Minnesota offense. He isn't the quickest option on the board, but he has the hands to make up for his lack of explosive speed.</p><p><h5>26) Miami Dolphins - RB Jonathan Taylor, Wisconsin</h5></p><p>With their third pick in the first round, I look for Miami to grab a running back. Many people have D'Andre Swift as the first tailback taken, but I believe that it will be Jonathan Taylor. A three-year starter at Wisconsin, Taylor has established himself as one of the most prolific running backs in Big Ten history. I expect him to be a great pick up, and I believe that he will continue to be a dominant runner at the next level.</p><p><h5>27) Seattle Seahawks - DE/EDGE A.J. Epenesa, Iowa</h5></p><p>It's no secret, Seattle is no longer home to the "Legion of Boom" if you will. However, drafting A.J. Epenesa could be a great piece to the puzzle for them. He is a big guy in stature, but don't let that fool you. Epenesa is quick off the line and he is a great pass rusher who is constantly in his opponent's backfield. He's coming off an 11 and a half sack season, and he will constantly apply pressure to an opposing team's quarterback.</p><p><h5>28) Baltimore Ravens - LB Kenneth Murray, Oklahoma</h5></p><p>The Ravens are one of the few teams who don't need much coming into draft day. They could stand to pick up a receiver, but I feel as though they will go linebacker here with Kenneth Murray. He's quick to the ball and is one of the best inside linebackers available in the draft this year. I don't see how Baltimore could pass up the opportunity to grab a top player at his position this late in the first round.</p><p><h5>29) Tennessee Titans - OT Josh Jones, Houston</h5></p><p>Tennessee has a glaring need for an offensive tackle after the departure of Jack Conklin during free agency. I believe they will move to replace him with the somewhat inconsistent Senior Bowl standout Josh Jones. His size and stature is perfect for the Titans who love to pound the rock. Jones has a high ceiling with loads of potential, and he could find himself with a long-term home in Nashville.</p><p><h5>30) Green Bay Packers - LB Patrick Queen, LSU</h5></p><p>All signs seem to indicate that the Packers are looking for a linebacker with their first-round pick, and Patrick Queen is a steal this late in the round. Some boards have him going higher, and he's considered as one of the top tier linebackers coming into the draft. Queen isn't quite the size of a normal NFL linebacker, but his quickness and football IQ is almost unmatched at his position.</p><p><h5>31) San Francisco 49ers - CB Cameron Dantzler, Mississippi State</h5></p><p>This pick may catch the casual fan slightly off guard. However, there's a method to my madness. San Francisco could stand to add a cornerback, and I believe they will look to Cameron Dantzler here. He put his name out there with an impressive Pro Day showing, and he's already held a pre-draft interview with the Niners. Dantzler is going to be a great addition to a Super Bowl contender.</p><p><h5>32) Kansas City Chiefs - RB D'Andre Swift, Georgia</h5></p><p>The defending Super Bowl champions don't need a ton as they are returning the majority of their starters. I believe that they will use this opportunity to snag a solid running back, something that their offense has been lacking despite being explosive. D'Andre Swift has put together back to back 1000+ yard seasons for Georgia and he could be the missing link to an already potent Kansas City offensive attack.</p>
