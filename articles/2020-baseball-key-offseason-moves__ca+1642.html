                        <p>The 2020 baseball season will include a universal DH and regular-season extra-inning games will start with a runner on second base. There will be just 60 games, but the postseason will be business as usual. Which teams will take advantage of the shortened schedule? Let's take a look at the key moves in the offseason for each MLB team.</p><p><strong>American League</strong></p><p><strong>Baltimore Orioles:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: SS Jose Inglesias</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Dylan Bundy, LHP Tommy Milone, DH Mark Trumbo, 2B Jonathan Villar, RHP Jimmy Yacabonis.</p><p>Analysis: It's going to be another long season in Baltimore or at least long-short season. The rebuilding plan does not include signing big-name free agents.</p><p><strong>Boston Red Sox:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: C Jonathan Lucroy, LHP Martin Perez, INF Jose Peraza, CF Kevin Pillar, C Kevin Plawecki, LHP Jeffrey Springs, OF Alex Verdugo.</p><p>Key Losses: OF Mookie Betts, RHP Andrew Cashner, RHP Jhoulys Chacin, INF Brock Holt, RHP Travis Lakins, INF Eduardo Nunez, C Sandy Leon, RHP Rick Porcello, 1B Steve Pearce, LHP David Price.</p><p>New manager Ron Roenicke takes over a team in transition. The Red Sox won just 84 games last season and going .500 might be a reach this season. They dumped salary and got rid of their best player in Betts to avoid luxury-tax penalties.</p><p><strong>Chicago White Sox:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Steve Cishek, INF Cheslor Cuthbert, DH Edwin Encarnacion, LHP Gio Gonzalez, C Yasmai Grandal, LHP Dallas Keuchel, OF Nomar Mazara.</p><p>Key Losses: C Wellington Castillo, RHP Dylan Covey, INF Ryan Goins, OF Jon Jay, RHP Nate Jones, RHY Juan Minaya, RHP Ivan Nova, 2B Yolmer Sanchez, OF Charlie Tilson.</p><p>Analysis: The White Sox keep improving and made some more strides with the additions of Grandal, Encarnacion and Keuchel. The best move might have been to keep leader Jose Abreu, when they signed him to a three-year deal. This is now a team that can compete for a playoff spot.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Indians:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Emmanuel Chase, OF Delino Deshields, 2B Cesar Hernandez, C Sandy Leon, LHP Tyler Olson, OF Domingo Santana.</p><p>Kye Losses: RHP Tyler Clippard, RHP A.J. Cole, 2B Jason Kipnis, RHP Corey Kluber, RHP Dan Otero, OF Yasiel Puig.</p><p>Analysis: This was a "meh" offseason. This is still a strong team, but the Twins are coming on strong in the AL Central and the Indians are cutting costs. They traded Kluber to Texas and did wind up with reliever Emmanuel Chase and Deshields, though it wasn't a big haul.</p><p><strong>Detroit Tigers:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Dario Agrazal, 1B C.J. Cron, OF Cameron Maybin, RHP Ivan Nova, C Austin Romine, 2B Jonathan Schoop.</p><p>Key Losses: INF Josh Harrison, RHP Edwin Jackson, OF Mikie Mahtook, RHP Tyson Ross.</p><p>Analysis: It's going to be a long year in Detroit. They are cutting costs because they overpaid for Miguel Cabrera and Jordan Zimmerman. Romine was a solid pickup as a power-hitting catch and Cron is at least a solid first baseman. Really not a lot to like about this offseason, but I can guarantee that they won't lose 114 games again this season.</p><p><strong>Houston Astros:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Jared Hughes, RHP Austin Pruitt.</p><p>Key Losses: C Robinson Chirinos, RHP Gerrit Cole, RHP Will Harris, OF Jake Marisnick, RHP Collin McHugh, LHP Wade Miley, RHP Hector Rondon, RHP Aaron Sanchez.</p><p>Analysis:</p><p>Dusty Baker takes over a Houston team that lost their manager, GM, best pitcher and one of their top relievers thanks to a cheating scandal. This is still a really good baseball team that should win the AL West. They are fortunate that there will probably be no fans in the stands to get heckled. But losing Cole is ultimately the biggest factor in Houston not getting back to the World Series.</p><p><strong>Kansas City Royals:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Chance Adams, 3B Maikel Franco, RHP Greg Holland, RHP Trevor Rosenthal.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Brad Boxenberger, INF Cheslor Cuthbert.</p><p>Analysis: The Royals are going to have another rough season, but at least they won't lose 100 games. Franco is the key addition and a new environment might help.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Angels:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Matt Andriese, RHP Dylan Bundy, C Jason Castro, 3B Anthony Rendon, RHP Julio Teheran.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Cody Allen, 1B Justin Bour, RHP Trevor Cahill, RF Kole Calhoun, RHP Matt Harvey, C Kevan Smith.</p><p>Analysis: The Angels had a good offseason, but it could have been great had they signed Gerrit Cole. They always seem to have a need for pitching, but the addition of Rendon should energize that lineup led by Mike Trout.</p><p><strong>Minnesota Twins:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: C Alex Avila, RHP Homer Bailey, RHP Jhoulys Chacin, RHP Tyler Clippard, 3B Josh Donaldson, LHP Rich Hill, RHP Kenta Maeda.</p><p>Key Losses: C Jason Castro, 1B C.J. Cron, RHP Kyle Gibson, RHP Ryne Harper, RHP Juan Minaya, LHP Martin Perez, 2B Jonathan Schoop, INF Ronald Torreyes.</p><p>Analysis: The Twins are getting ready to compete in the American League with the addition of Donaldson. They have a pretty good staff now, but they lack an ace.</p><p><strong>New York Yankees:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Chad Bettis, RHP Gerrit Cole, RHP Adam Warren.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Chance Adams, 1B Greg Bird, RHP Dellin Betances, OF Jacob Ellsbury, DH Edwin Encarnacion, SS Didi Gregorius, OF Cameron Maybin, C Austin Romine, LHP C.C. Sabathia.</p><p>Analysis: The whole offseason is about picking up Gerrit Cole, a dominant right-hander who should be able to take the Yankees to the next level. The key is now for their big guys in Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton to stay healthy.</p><p><strong>Oakland Athletics:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: INF Ryan Goins, OF Tony Kemp.</p><p>Key Losses: LHP Brett Anderson, RHP Homer Bailey, C Josh Phegley, INF Jurickson Profar, RHP Tanner Roark, RHP Blake Treinen.</p><p>Analysis: Oakland did very little in the offseason and lost some key pitchers due to budgetary issues. This should still be a pretty good team, but getting to the playoffs will be a lot tougher.</p><p><strong>Seattle Mariners:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: LHP Wei-Yin Chen, RHP Carl Edwards Jr., OF Carlos Gonzalez, RHP Yoshihisa Hirano, RHP Taijuan Walker.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Anthony Bass, 3B Ryon Healy, RHP Felix Hernandez, LHP Wade LeBlanc, LHP Tommy Milone, C Omar Narvez, OF Domingo Santana.</p><p>Analysis: The Mariners were bad last season and didn't do a whole lot to improve their team. Fortunately, they have a strong farm system so the future is bright.</p><p><strong>Tampa Bay Rays:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Dylan Covey, OF Jose Martinez, OF Hunter Renfroe, C Kevan Smith, 1B/OF Yoshitomo Tsutsugo.</p><p>Key Losses: 1B Jesus Aguilar, C Travis d'Arnaud, INF Matt Duffy, OF Avisail Garcia, OF Tommy Pham, INF Eric Sogard.</p><p>Analysis: The Rays will usually compete, but they are also in the business to keep payroll low. Adding Martinez will help a team that needed some power and Renfroe will help as well. Tsutsugo is a 28-year old slugger from Japan who was signed for $14 million.</p><p><strong>Texas Rangers:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: 1B Greg Bird, C Robinson Chirinos, INF Matt Duffy, 3B Todd Frazier, RHP Kyle Gibson, RHP Corey Kluber, RHP Jordan Lyles, 1B Sam Travis.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Emmanuel Chase, OF Delino Deshields, INF Logan Forsythe, OF Nomar Mazara, OF Hunter Pence, LHP Jeffrey Springs.</p><p>Analysis: Texas missed out on adding Anthony Rendon, but did add to their staff by picking up Kluber in a deal. He's a great pickup if he can rebound from injuries and regain his Cy Young form. Frazier will be a nice boost to the offense, but they don't seem to have enough to compete with the big boys in the AL.</p><p><strong>Toronto Blue Jays:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Anthony Bass, RHP A.J. Cole, 2B Joe Panik, RHP Tanner Roark, LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu, INF Travis Shaw.</p><p>Key Losses: RPH Derek Law, LHP Clayton Richard, 1B Justin Smoak, INF Richard Urena.</p><p>Analysis: The Blue Jays signed Ryu, the runner-up for the 2019 NL Cy Young and that made their offseason. They also added Roark and Shaw to really improve their rotation. If the Jays have a home and they are allowed to play in Toronto, they could be a darkhorse candidate in the American League.</p><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: LHP Madison Bumgarner, OF Kole Calhoun, RHP Junior Guerra, C John Hicks, RHP Edwin Jackson, OF Jon Jay, OF Starling Marte, INF Brad Miller, RHP Hector Rondon.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Matt Andriese, C Alex Avila, OF Jarrod Dyson, RHP Yoshihisa Hirano, RHP Greg Holland, OF Adam Jones, C Blake Swihart, RHP Taijuan Walker.</p><p>Analysis: The addition of Bumgarner made their offseason, Now they have an ace that could take them to the playoffs and advance. They also added Marte, so there's no reason why this team can't at least compete for a playoff spot.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Braves:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: 1B Yonder Alonso, C Travis d'Arnaud, LHP Cole Hamels, RHP Felix Hernandez, LHP Will Smith, 3B Yangervis Solarte.</p><p>Key Losses: LHP Jerry Blevins, 3B Josh Donaldson, OF Billy Hamilton, OF Matt Joyce, LHP Dallas Keuchel, C John Ryan Murphy, RHP Anthony Swarzak, RHP Julio Teheran, RHP Dan Winkler.</p><p>Analysis: The Braves have the tools to make a run for the NL crown. They have won the NL East two seasons in a row and should win a third. Losing Donaldson though was a big blow, but they are still loaded with talent.</p><p><strong>Chicago Cubs:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Jeremy Jeffress, 2B Jason Kipnis, LHP Tyler Olson, C Josh Phegley, RHP David Phelps, RHP Casey Sandler, OF Steven Souza, Jr., RHP Dan Winkler.</p><p>Key Losses: OF Nicholas Castellanos, OF Carlos Gonzalez, LHP Cole Hamels, RHP Brandon Kintzler, INF Addison Russell, RHP Pedro Strop, INF Ben Zobrist.</p><p>Analysis: David Ross takes over as manager for Joe Maddon, The Cubs let Castellanos and Hamels go because they didn't want to pay them. They didn't really improve the team with their average additions.</p><p><strong>Cincinnati Reds:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: OF Shogo Akiyama, OF Nicholas Castellanos, RHP Nate Jones, 2B Mike Moustakas, RHP Pedro Strop, LHP Wade Miley.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Kevin Gausman, SS Jose Iglesias, OF Matt Kemp, INF Jose Peraza, LHP Alex Wood.</p><p>Analysis: The Reds continue to improve their team. The additions of Moustakas and Castellanos will add a lot of punch to their lineup. They also added another outfielder in Akiyama, a 32-year old lead-off hitter from Japan.</p><p>Colorado Rockies:</p><p>Key Additions: C Elias Diaz, INF Chris Owings.</p><p>Key Losses: 1B Yonder Alonso, LHP Tyler Anderson, RHP Chad Bettis, LHP Mike Dunn.</p><p>Analysis: The Rockies were terrible last seaon, but at least they still have Nolan Arenado. At some point, he will be gone and they'll go into a complete rebuild. Considering they did very little in the offseason, they appear to be moving in that direction.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Dodgers:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: OF Mookie Betts, INF Jedd Gyorki, LHP David Price, RHP Blake Treinen, LHP Alex Wood.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Yimi Garcia, LHP Rich Hill, RHP Kenta Maeda, C Russell Martin, LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu, RHP Casey Sadler.</p><p>Analysis: The Dodgers picked up Betts in a deal that was the move of the winter on offense. However, they lost Ryu and didn't sign Gerrit Cole. The hope is that Price can give them something close to what he was with Tampa Bay.</p><p>Miami Marlins:</p><p>Key Additions: 1B Jesus Aguilar, RHP Brad Boxborger, C Francisco Cervelli, OF Corey Dickerson, RHP Yimi Garcia, OF Matt Kemp, RHP Brandon Kintzler, OF/INF Sean Rodriguez, 2B Jonathan Villar.</p><p>Key Losses: 2B Starling Castro, LHP Wei-Yin Chen, OF Curtis Granderson, 3B Martin Prado, INF Neil Walker.</p><p>Analysis: The Marlins made some nice additions to make them somewhat competitive as they continue their decade-long rebuild.</p><p><strong>Milwaukee Brewers:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: LHP Brett Anderson, OF Avisail Garcia, INF Jedd Gyorki, 3B Ryon Healy, INF Brock Holt, LHP Eric Lauer, 1B Logan Morrison, C Omar Narvaez, 1B Justin Smoak, INF Eric Sogard, 2B Luis Urias.</p><p>Key Losses: LHP Gio Gonzalez, RHP Zach Davies, C Yasmani Grandal, RHP Trent Grisham, RHP Junior Guerra, RHP Jeremy Jeffress, RHP Jordan Lyles, 2B Mike Moustakas, RHP Jimmy Nelson, RHP David Phelps, LHP Drew Pomeranz, 1B/OF Eric Thames.</p><p>Analysis: Milwaukee missed out on some key pickups because they are concerned about payroll. The pitching staff was upgraded some with the addition of Anderson. Adding Garcia, Smoak and Healy will help replace Moustakas and Thames in the middle of the lineup.</p><p><strong>NY Mets:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: 1B Matt Adams, RHP Delin Betances, OF Jake Marisnick, RHP Rick Porcello, RHP Michael Wacha.</p><p>Key Losses: 3B Todd Frazier, CF Juan Legares, 2B Joe Panik, RHP Zach Wheeler.</p><p>Analysis: The Mets brought in some pitching help bud did lose Wheeler. They also lost Thor (Noah Syndergaard) for the entire season with Tommy John surgery and that's the most devastating loss.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Phillies:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: INF Logan Forsythe, SS Didi Gregorius, INF Josh Harrison, LHP Francisco Liriano, RHP Anthony Swarzak, INF Ronald Torreyes, INF Neil Walker, RHP Zack Wheeler.</p><p>Key Losses: OF Corey Dickerson, RHP Jerad Eickhoff, 3B Maikel Franco, 2B Cesar Hernandez, RHP Jared Hughes, OF Mikie Mahtook, INF Brad Miller, 1B Logan Morrison, RHP Juan Nicasio, INF/OF Sean Rodriguez, LHP Drew Smyly, LHP Jason Vargas.</p><p>Analysis: The Phillies hired Joe Girardi and fired Gabe Kapler. That was their best move, though getting Gregorius was huge. They also added Wheeler to join ace Aaron Nola. The NL East is going to be fun to watch this year.</p><p><strong>Pittsburgh Pirates:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: CF Jarrod Dyson, OF Guillermo Heredia, LHP Derek Holland, C John Ryan Murphy, SS/OF JT Riddle, OF Charlie Tilson.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Dario Agrazal, OF Melky Cabrera, C Francisco Cervelli, C Elias Diaz, INF Jung Ho Kang, LHP Francisco Liriano, OF Starling Marte.</p><p>Analysis: The Pirates had a lot of holes and still do after getting rid of Marte. Standing pat for the most part, means another rough season in 2020.</p><p>St. Louis Cardinals:</p><p>Key Additions: LHP Kwang-hyun Kim.</p><p>Key Losses: OF Jose Martinez, LF Marcell Ozuna, LHP Chason Shreve, RHP Michael Wacha.</p><p>Analysis: The Cards lost Ozuna, who hit 29 homers last season and didn't replace him. Their big move was bringing back Adam Wainright, who is 38. They should still be contenders though, in the NL Central.</p><p><strong>San Diego Padres:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: RHP Kyle Barraclough, RHP Zach Davies, RHP Jerad Eickhoff, RHP Trent Grisham, RHP Emilio Pagan, INF Ryan Goins, LHP Drew Pomeranz, INF Jurickson Profar, OF Tommy Pham, RHP Craig Stammen, RHP Jimmy Yacabonis.</p><p>Key Losses: RHP Carl Edwards Jr., 2B Ian Kinsler, LHP Eric Lauer, OF Hunter Renfroe, 2B Luis Urias, RHP Adam Warren.</p><p>Analysis: The Padres should be more competitive this year after all the moves they made. Pham and Profar should help, but they aren't stars.</p><p>San Francisco Giants:</p><p>Key Additions: LHP Tyler Anderson, LHP Jerry Blevins, RHP Trevor Cahill, RHP Kevin Gausman, OF Billy Hamilton, OF Hunter Pence, RHP Tyler Ross, 2B Yolmer Sanchez, LHP Drew Smyly.</p><p>Key Losses: LHP Kyle Barraclough, LHP Madison Bumgarner, CF Kevin Pillar, LHP Will Smith, 3B Yangervis Solarte.</p><p>Analysis: New manager Gabe Kapler takes over for Bruch Bochy, who retired. Unfortunately for Kapler, he is entering a squad that is about to go through a rebuild, especially with Bumgarner off to Arizona.</p><p><strong>Washington Nationals:</strong></p><p>Key Additions: 2B Starlin Castro, RHP Ryne Harper, RHP Will Harris, 1B/OF Eric Thames.</p><p>Key Losses: 1B Matt Adams, 2B Brian Dozier, RHP Jeremy Hellickson, 3B Anthony Rendon, RHP Fernando Rodney, LHP Tony Sipp.</p><p>Analysis: The loss of Rendon could be the reason the Nats don't make the playoffs. You don't replace a great third baseman with Castro or young Carter Kieboom. Getting Josh Donaldson would have helped, but they couldn't get him. But they re-signed Steven Strasburg and the fact that there is a DH, will help Howie Kendrick. Fortunately, their starting pitching is elite.</p><p><em>(some info from Bleacher Report, Sporting News.com and NJ.com).</em></p>
