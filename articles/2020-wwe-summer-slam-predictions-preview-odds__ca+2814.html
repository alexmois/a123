                        <p>It&rsquo;s time for the biggest party of the summer, which is known as Summer Slam. The event will take place at the Thunderdome, which was unveiled on Friday night. There will be no &ldquo;Live&rdquo; fans in the stands but the WWE has adopted the idea of the virtual fans that the NBA currently employs. It was interesting to watch and I feel it was a success. Now let&rsquo;s get to al the action as I will break down every match on the card.</p><p>All odds are courtesy of <a href="http://www.betonline.ag">Betonline.ag</a></p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-16f825f1-7fff-4c35-a64b-4964dcdb908a"></strong></p><p><strong>Mandy Rose (-450) vs Sonya DeVille (+275) - No Disqualification Loser Leaves WWE Match</strong></p><p>This was originally supposed to be a Hair vs Hair Match but on Friday night, Sonya Deville decided to up the ante and make it a no DQ Loser Leaves WWE Match. One has to wonder if the WWE didn&rsquo;t set it up that way to give Sonya a way out of the company after someone tried to kidnap her last week. It is an interesting thought. Still, this should be a fun match between two women, who were once best friends. Sonya Deville then turned her back on Mandy after Rose got into a &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; with Otis. The two have been at odds ever since and Mandy tried to extend an olive branch this past Friday but it was rejected by Sonya, who then upped the stakes for this match. The No DQ stipulation also means that we could see some outsiders get involved, but who? Will shall see. Still, I feel that it will be Mandy Rose that comes out on top and stays with the company while Sonya Deville is gone. <strong>Prediction: Many Rose (-450).</strong></p><p><strong><br />Apollo Crews (-200) vs MVP (+150) - United States Title Match</strong></p><p>This one should be a war between a couple of gentlemen that truly do not like each other. A little while ago, the WWE brass gave Apollo Crews some new entrance music and a new attitude in order to give him a push and it has worked. These two were supposed to meet for the title back at Extreme Rules Horror Show but an injury forced Apollo to miss that match. MVP had paid for a new Championship Belt design and declared himself the winner by default. He was not the official champ. A couple of weeks late, Crews defeated MVP in an official title match to retain his title and take the new belt that MVP paid for. MVP felt slighted that night as the lights were flickering on and off, which turned out to be the antics of a new group called Retribution, so he demanded another match and it will take place here at Summer Slam. The problem for crews in this one is that he will need to overcome outside interference from the rest of the Hurt Business, comprising of Bobby Lashley and Shelton Benjamin. Can Crews overcome all of the odds? I think he will be able to. Crews does have a bit of back up of his own in Ricochet, Mustafa Ali, and Cedric Alexander. I expect two of them to come to the aid of Crews and help him retain. <strong>Prediction: Apollo Crews (-200).</strong></p><p><strong><br />Bayley (-120) vs Asuka (-120)</strong></p><p>Bayley and Sasha Banks have all the gold in woman&rsquo;s division as they both hold singles titles along with the Tag Titles. Bayley has been the Smackdown woman&rsquo;s title and it is on the line in this one against Asuka, who has been on quite a roll of late. Asuka earned her shot for this title by being a surprise entrant in a tri-brand battle royal and by winning it. It was a surprise because Asuka was already slated to face Sasha Banks at this event. It will be a busy night for the Empress of Tomorrow. Asuka also wants revenge after Bayley cost her the Raw woman&rsquo;s title by attacking her friend Kari Sane. Another caveat here is that Bayley had said she was going tp go 2nd on this night but after failing in a beat-the-clock challenge against Sasha when the pair had to square off against Naomi on the same bight, she will now go first. Is this night finally going to be the end of the Sasha/ Bayley friendship? They are still tag title holders but we could see some dissension between the pair tonight. Also, there are rumors that Bayley and Sasha could face Shayna Baszler and Asuka for the Tag Titles at Payback, which will take place a week later. Could we see the first woman to hold all three belts at the same time? I feel that Asuka will take her first step in doing so with a win tonight against Bayley. <strong>Prediction: Asuka (-120)</strong></p><p><strong><br />Braun Stroman (+150) vs Bray (&ldquo;The Fiend) Wyatt (-200) - Falls Count Anywhere Universal Championship Match</strong></p><p>I am really looking forward to this one, especially since it is going to be a Falls Count Anywhere Match. It is not often that you will find Braun Stroman an underdog but that is exactly what we have here. In the last two matches between these two, it was Bray Wyatt that took on Braun, but for this one, it will be his alter ego, &ldquo;The Fiend&rdquo;. Back at Horror Show, the two hooked up in a Swamp Match and Bray brought Braun into the Swamp, and the show ended with The Fiend making an appearance. I predicted a win in that match for Bray, which would tie the series up at 1-1 and I also felt that it would go to a 3rd match here at Summer Slam, which it has. Braun has been the Title Holder since he won it at Wrestlemania, but can he hold on to it through another PPV? We shall see. They say that you are never the same after an encounter with Bray Wyatt and Braun has taken a turn to the dark side of late by turning heel. Even his good friend Alexa Bliss couldn&rsquo;t talk some sense into him. She played a role in the loss at Horror Show for Braun and she will probably make an appearance in this one. Is she going to hurt or help the Monster Among Men? I think that she will hurt him. This is Bray&rsquo;s time to win back the belt and then hold it for a while. Possibly till at least Wrestlemania. <strong>Prediction: The Fiend (-200).</strong></p><p><strong><br />Drew McIntyre (-170) vs Randy Orton (+130) - WWE Championship Match</strong></p><p>I am already predicting that the Universal title will change hands. Could we see the same with the WWE Title? It&rsquo;s possible as Randy Orton will face Drew McIntyre. Drew won the WWE Title back at Wrestlemania when he defeated Brock Lesnar in under five minutes. That is no easy feat. This will also be no easy feat for Drew as he will be Facing the Legend Killer, who has been on a tear of late and who has world Titles to his credit in his career, which is two behind both Ric Flair and John Cena. In the last few months, Orton has taken out Edge and Christian, The Big Show and he also attacked Ric flair, who had been by his side of late. Orton has had some moments against Drew, including dropping him with an RKO after McIntyre took defeated Dolph Ziggler at Extreme Rules. Drew has been a fighting champion, unlike Brock, and he will fight to the end to save his Title but I do feel that Orton is the play in this one. He is very dangerous and has an RKO that he can hit at any time. Drew will never see it coming and Orton will walk away with his 15th title. <strong>Prediction: Randy Orton (+130).</strong></p><p><strong><br />Asuka (-170) vs Sasha Banks (+130) - Raw Woman&rsquo;s Title</strong></p><p>This has a chance to be a big night for Asuka as she has two title opportunities. The Raw Woman&rsquo;s Title will be the 2nd of the two. She will face Bayley in the first one after Sasha won the beat the clock challenge against Bayley by defeating Naomi this past Friday evening. Asuka won the Title back at the Money In The Bank PPV but she didn&rsquo;t realize it until the next night when Becky Lynch relinquished the title due to being pregnant. A few weeks ago on Raw, Sasha won the belt against Asuka thanks to some help from Bayley. The Match had a stipulation that if any wrestler was DQ&rsquo;d for any reason, the winner would automatically win the belt. Bayley took advantage of that by beating up Kari Sane in the ack and Asuka had to make a choice. She chose to help her friend and was then counted out. At the end of the night, Sasha and Bayley each had singles titles and they were also Tag title holders. The Golden Role Models had all the gold, but I see that changing on this night. It is time for Asuka as I expect here to beat Bayley and then she will take down Sasha here to hold both belts. This should be a great match though. <strong>Prediction: Asuka -170</strong></p><p><strong><br />Seth Rollins (-150) vs Dominik Mysterio (+110) - Street Fight</strong></p><p>Rey Mysterio may be close to retiring from the WWE but his son is ready to step up and make a name for himself. Two weeks ago on Raw, Dominik Mysterio signed a contract to face Seth Rollins at Summer Slam and he also signed a contract to be an official WWE superstar. His first task will not be easy but Dominik says that he is ready. This will be a very deeply personal match as the younger Mysterio is out for revenge after Seth gouged out his father&rsquo;s eye back at Extreme Rules Horror Show. That was a brutal eye-for-an-eye match and this one will be brutal as well as it is a street fight. A couple of weeks ago, Seth and Murphy tied up Dominik in the ropes and let him have it with many Kendo stick shots. It was a brutal attack but this past week, Rey and his son got a measure of revenge. That now sets the stage for this Steet Fight. Can Dominik win his first official match as a member of the Raw roster? I think that he can and I also feel that he will get some help from his father or at least Rey will make it a fair fight by running interference from Murphy. <strong>Prediction: Dominik Mysterio</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Street Profits (+125) vs Andrade & Angel Garza (-160) - Raw Tag Team Championship Match</strong></p><p>This should be a very interesting match. The Street Profits have been the champs for a little while but they have also been used as more of a comic relief duo. They will have to be far more focused and serious if they hope to knock off the talented team of Andrade and Angel Garza. The Pair has had some squabbles but they appear to be on the same page at the moment, thanks to Selina Vega, who is their manager. Vega did step in the ring this past week as she faced and lost to Bianca Belair. The former NXT star accused Vega of poisoning her husband Montex Ford a few weeks ago. He had collapsed during a match and the Doctors said that he was poisoned. Backstage video does show her around one of the drinks that Ford would take, so the evidence may be there. Still, the trio of Vega, Andrade, and Garza seems like a well-oiled machine at the moment and they will put up a hell of a fight. I do not see them winning the belts though. I feel that we will see some cracks with the pair and also I can see Bianca getting involved in the match to neutralize the effect of Vega. Street Profits retain. <strong>Prediction: Street Profits</strong></p>
