                        <p><h4><strong>Seventh Round</strong></h4></p><p><strong>215)Cincinnati Bengals, LB Markus Bailey, LB Purdue. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good value here. Bailey is 6-1, 235 with a 4th-5th round value. Not great size, but at this point, you take what you can get. The issue? He suffered a torn ACL twice in his in college career to both legs. If not for that, he would be a mid-round pick.</p><p><strong>216)Washington Redskins, S Kamren Curl, Arkansas. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Curl is 6-1, 206 and has long arms. Just not very fast. Doesn't have great physical tools. But plays hard and has good instincts. The physical tools are not enough to make him a starter. Will have to make it on special teams.</p><p><strong>217)San Francisco 49ers, WR Jauan Jennings, Tennessee. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Last pick for the 49ers and they got a big receiver who is 6-3, 215. Loves to catch the ball in traffic and is a powerful runner. But runs a 4.72 40. Not going to outrun people.</p><p><strong>218)New York Giants, Edge Carter Coughlin, Minnesota. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Giants own the seventh round with four picks. Not sure that's a good thing. Coughlin is 6-3, 236, and can get to the passer. Not good size. Might end up at the "Sam" linebacker spot. No relation to former coach Tom Coughlin.</p><p><strong>219)Baltimore Ravens, S Geno Stone, Iowa. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens trade into the draft to get Stone, who was a two-year starter. Pretty good pick here as he projected to be a 4th or 5th rounder. Average size at 5-10, 207. Speed is ordinary at 4.62 in the 40 and short arms. But good instincts.</p><p>Will need to play Teams to make it.</p><p><strong>220)LA Chargers, WR K.J. Hill, Ohio State. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Did everybody get drafted on Ohio State? Hill is a solid pick for this late. He's not very fast (4.6 40) with short arms, but at around 6-0, 196, makes plays and is shifty. He's more quick than fast which likely means he'll have to make it as a slot receiver.</p><p><strong>221)Carolina Panthers, CB Stantley Thomas-Oliver III, FIU. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Well, he does have three first names. Do you think the Panthers focused on defense? Every pick was on the defensive end. Thomas-Oliver is 6-0, 192 and has some good instincts in coverage. Not great hands but 4.48 speed. That makes it worth it this late.</p><p><strong>222)Arizona Cardinals, RB Eno Benjamin, Arizona State. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a strong pick for the Cards, who had a decent draft. Benjamin is 5-9, 207 and has a chance to be a third-down back.</p><p><strong>223)Jacksonville Jaguars, CB Chris Claybrooks, Memphis. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Small corner at 5-9, 177. But he does have good speed and can return kicks. Former receiver who is still learning the position. Will have to make the team as a return man.</p><p><strong>224)Tennessee Titans, QB Cole McDonald, Hawaii. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: McDonald is 6-3, 215 and is a pretty good athlete. He ran a 4.58 40, which is actually faster than Jalen Hurts. What does that mean? Not much. His long delivery is a concern. Stats are inflated in Hawaii's offense. But as a developmental player, this isn't a bad pick.</p><p><strong>225)Minnesota Vikings, Edge Kenny Willekes, Michigan State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Willekes is 6-3, 264 with below average speed for an Edge (4.87). Has short arms, but plays the run well and is relentless. Oh yes, he has a motor. Of course, that's code for doesn't have great athletic numbers. Will be tough to make the team considering the Vikes have 15 picks. But is a solid pick late in the round.</p><p><strong>226)Chicago Bears, OT Arlington Hambright, Colorado. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments: A former juco prospect who will have to move to guard. Was hurt in 2018. Pretty raw.</p><p><strong>227)Chicago Bears, OG Lachavious Simmons, Tennessee State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: A 6-5, 304 pound guard with long arms. Pretty raw, but good thing is he played every position on the line except for center. That could help him make the team.</p><p><strong>228)Atlanta Falcons, P Sterling Hofrichter, Syracuse. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: This is where you should pick a punter. A consistent punter with good hangtime, who can also kick off when necessary.</p><p><strong>229)Washington Redskins, Edge James Smith-Williams, NC State. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-4, 265 with a 4.60 40 time. Very smart player off the field, but also has injury history. Fortunately, he can always use his tools in the classroom to become a success off the field.</p><p><strong>230)New England Patriots, C Dustin Woodard, Memphis. Grade: D+</strong></p><p>Comments: Last pick for the Pats, who had an interesting draft. They didn't take a quarterback and traded out of the first round. Woodard is undersized at 6-1, 295 and was a reach here.</p><p><strong>231)Dallas Cowboys, QB Ben DiNucci, James Madison. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Athletic quarterback who was accurate. More of a read-option threat at JMU. At best, he's a backup.</p><p><strong>232)Pittsburgh Steelers, DT Carlos Davis, Nebraska. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Davis ran a 4.82 40 at 313 pounds. His brother Khalil is a better prospect and was drafted earlier by Tampa Bay. Raw but worth a look here.</p><p><strong>233)Philadelphia Eagles, Edge Casey Toohill, Stanford. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Fits as a 3-4 outside linebacker at 6-4, 250) Good burst and closing speed. Can get pushed around. But has pass rush potential.</p><p><strong>234)LA Rams, LB Clay Johnston, Baylor. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Athletic linebacker who is coming off a knee injry last year and foot injuries in previous seasons. Not a bad gamble late.</p><p><strong>235)Detroit Lions, DT Jashon Cornell, Ohio State, Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Had four sacks last year in first season as a starter. Lacks size, but has some upside.</p><p><strong>236)Green Bay Packers, S Vernon Scott, TCU. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Scott has cover skills and is solid in run support. But didn't make enough plays to really be considered.</p><p><strong>237)Kansas City Chiefs, CB Bopete Keyes, Tulane. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-1, 202 and can match up with bigger receivers. Needs some work but a solid pick here.</p><p><strong>238)New York Giants, ILB South Carolina. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: At this point, if you can get an experienced linebacker who is a very good tackler, you take your chances and hope he can play special teams.</p><p><strong>239)Buffalo Bills, CB Dane Jackson, Pittsburgh. Grade:D</strong></p><p>Comments: Average size at 6-0, 187. Not very fast and not a ballhawk. Ran a 4.57 40 at the combine. Just might not have the quickness to make it. Will have to play teams.</p><p><strong>240)New Orleans Saints, QB Tommy Stevens, Mississippi State. Grade: </strong>D</p><p>Comments: Saints had just four picks. Stevens is 6-5, 235 and is athletic. But very much a developmental pick and not ready to take over for Drew Brees anytime soon.</p><p><strong>241)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, OLB Temple. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Had ACL injuries in 2016 and 2017. Has good length and could make it as a backup. Not enough bulk to start.</p><p><strong>242)Green Bay Packers, DE Jonathan Garvin, Miami-Fl. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Raw selection. At 6-4, 263, has long frame and size. Good quickness and quickness. Like the pick.</p><p><strong>243)Tennessee Titans, CB Chris Jackson, Marshall. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Played for four seasons at Marshall. Not a lot of big plays. At 5-10, 183 with speed, he'll have a chance to make it as a nickel corner and on special teams.</p><p><strong>244)Minnesota Vikings, QB Nate Stanley, Iowa. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Stanley is an average athlete and a typical drop-back passer at 6-3, 235. Typical backup quarterback without great tools.</p><p><strong>245)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, RB Raymond Calais, Louisiana. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Smallish back but does run a 4.42 40. Can slash and return kicks. Has enough speed to stick.</p><p><strong>246)Miami Dolphins, WR Malcolm Perry, Navy. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: How can you not root for this guy. Perry was an option quarterback at Navy who ran for 4,359 yards. Not sure he can make the transition to wide receiver. But he has the speed and shiftiness to make people miss.</p><p><strong>247)NY Giants, CB Chris Williamson, Minnesota. Grade:D</strong></p><p>Comments: Is he a safety or a corner? That's never a good question to ask unless you're Xavier McKinney. His tackling is good enough to play safety and doesn't have the speed to play an outside corner.</p><p><strong>248)LA Rams, PK Sam Sloman, Miami (OH). Grade:D</strong></p><p>Comments: Not sure this is the guy to replace Greg "the Leg" Zuerlein. He doesn't have the leg. But had a good senior season and was accurate.</p><p><strong>249)Minnesota Vikings, S Brian Cole, Mississippi State. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: A former receiver and Michigan State transfer. A box safety with some size at 6-2, 213.</p><p><strong>250)LA Rams, OG Tremayne Anchrum, Clemson. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Played right tackle for Clemson, but should be a guard in the NFL. Nice pick here because he can certainly run block.</p><p><strong>251)Miami Dolphins, TE Stephen Sullivan, LSU. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: He's a former receiver at 6-5, who caught just 12 passes last season. Not sure why he was drafted other than he went to LSU.</p><p><strong>252)Denver Broncos, WR Tyrie Cleveland, Florida. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Another receiver for John Elway Cleveland caught just 25 passes as a senior, so he wasn't picked based on his college production.</p><p><strong>253)Minnesota Vikings, OG Kyle Hinton, Washburn. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Three-year starter with short arms. Going from Division II Washburn to the NFL is tough. But he did well at his Pro Day and is worth a look.</p><p><strong>254)Denver Broncos, OLB Derrek Tuszka, North Dakota State. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Comes from best FCS program in the nation. Decent size at 6-4, 251. Short arms for an OLB. Good instincts. Good pick here by Elway.</p><p><strong>255)New York Giants, LB Tae Crowder, Georgia. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Mr. Irrelvant plays the run well and is a high-effort (high-motor) play without great physical attributes. But has a chance of making the team.</p>
