Each week we will review the starting nine teams in baseball and update each team&rsquo;s odds to win the league title and World Series. Let&rsquo;s play ball!</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-ea8df145-7fff-162e-89fe-9b64ba3763d4"></strong></p><p>Starting Nine (Week of April 3rd)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#9. St.Louis Cardinals (+750/+1600) - The Cardinals might be in the market for starting pitching again, much like last season&rsquo;s trade deadline. They have as good a 3-4 tandem in baseball with MVP Goldschmidt and Arenado and a bullpen loaded with power arms. Given the weak division they play in, the Cardinals don&rsquo;t need to panic should they start slowly.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#8. Cleveland Guardians (+1000/+2200) - The Guardians won&rsquo;t spend like many of the teams in front of them but they have speed, selective hitters, and very strong pitching. Manager Terry Francona certainly knows how to get the most out of his teams so the Guardians will be a threat.</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>#7. New York Mets (+450/+800) - With a new, deep-pocketed owner, the Mets look like they are finally on a spending par with the Yankees. Verlander&rsquo;s shoulder injury is a concern and the backend of the bullpen needs help but, they can spend their way back in.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#6. New York Yankees (+370/+750) - The Yankees resigned Aaron Judge, which was a must. They didn&rsquo;t, however, address much of the team&rsquo;s pitching woes. As always, however, never discount the Yankees' ability to add salary and make deals at the deadline.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#5. LA Dodgers (+400/+850) - The Dodgers were surprisingly quiet on the free agent front this offseason. They still have talent and excellent pitching. They also have a farm system and plenty of money to add talent at the trade deadline. They won&rsquo;t win 111 games again but this is a playoff team.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#4. Toronto Blue Jays (+600/+1200) - The Blue Jays might not have a true ace but they have pitching depth. The team did part ways with two of their starting outfielders from last season but they still have one of the best lineups in the American League.</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>#3. San Diego Padres (+500/+950) - The Padres proved last season that the team is willing to part with assets to help the major league roster. They have arguably the best lineup in the NL and don&rsquo;t dismiss this team from trading a major asset (Fernando Tatis Jr. comes to mind) to add a top-tier starter.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#2. Atlanta Braves (+370/+750) - The Braves are in a prime position to win a second World Series title in three seasons. They have youth, depth, and a deep farm system. If the Braves have a weakness, it could be at the back end of the bullpen but they have the assets to add someone at the trade deadline.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Houston Astros (+320/+650) - The Champs are the inaugural #1 team in our starting nine and for good reason. Despite losing Cy Young winner Justin Verlander, the Astros still have a top-notch starting rotation, the deepest bullpen in baseball, and young stars in the everyday lineup like Jeremy Pena, Yordan Alvarez, and Kyle Tucker to be the cornerstones for the next several years.</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>AL/NL MVP Candidates:</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the favorites to win the major awards in MLB heading into the season. We will rank the top five candidates in each league each week this season.</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>Top-five AL MVP Candidates</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Shohei Ohtani (+200) - the potential free agent is a fairly heavy favorite to win the award for the second time in three seasons. The Angels&rsquo; record will not impact his MVP chances because of his two-way dominance.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#2. Aaron Judge (+600) - Judge has the second-best odds to start the season, looking to become the first repeat MVP since the Tigers&rsquo; Miguel Cabrera turned the trick in 2012-13. Two home runs to start the season haven&rsquo;t hurt his cause.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#3. Julio Rodriguez (+700) - the oddsmakers like the chances of last year&rsquo;s AL ROY taking the next step toward superstardom. He has all the tools; speed, power, and defense.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#4. Mike Trout (+800) - Trout has won the award three times and, if he stays healthy, will be a threat again this season.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#5. Yordan Alvarez (+1000) - Alvarez put up big numbers last year for the world champs. His lack of defense could hurt his cause.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Top-five NL MVP Candidates</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Juan Soto (+550) - Soto is another player in a walk-year that will be motivated to put up numbers. He also happens to be playing for one of the best teams in the NL.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#2. Mookie Betts (+950) - One of the more complete players in the game, and the 2018 AL MVP, Betts is always a threat to win the MVP award.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#3. Ronald Acuna (+1000) - Acuna had an off-year last year but he could have a massive year with the new rules changes, particularly on the base paths.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#4. Trea Turner (+1100) - Turner&rsquo;s power numbers could see a bump playing in Philadelphia&rsquo;s hitter-friendly park for 81 games and he should also up his steal total this year as well.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#5. Nolan Arenado (+1200) - The Cards are the favorite to win the NL Central Division and, like his teammate Goldschmidt last year, Arenado should be in the MVP conversation.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Top-three AL Cy Young Candidates</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Gerrit Cole (+600) - the ace of the Yankees has all the tools and he has the media machine of New York City behind him.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#2. Dylan Cease (+850) - Cease was dominant for stretches last year. If he is a tad more consistent, he could be the favorite.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#3. Jacob deGrom (+850) - the two-time NL Cy Young Award winner took his talents to Texas and, despite a poor opening start, has all the tools to win his first in the AL if he can stay healthy.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Top-three NL Cy Young Candidates</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Sandy Alcantara (+550) - Alcantara looks to be the first NL Cy Young repeat winner since deGrom pulled the trick in 2018-19. He will once again have to do so with little support from the Marlins&rsquo; weak-hitting lineup."<br /><br /></p><p>#2. Corbin Burnes (+600) - Burnes took home the award in 2021 before taking a step back last season. Burnes, like Alcantara, may have to do his work while pitching for a weak-hitting lineup in Milwaukee.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#3. Max Scherzer (+800) - the 3-time Cy Young award winner is always a favorite to win the award despite his advancing age. Like Cole in the AL, he plays in the right market and for a team that should threaten for a playoff spot.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>*All odds courtesy of Draftkings.com</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>By Mark Ruelle</p><p><br /><br /></p>
