                        <p>The Grand Final of the CS:GO DreamHack Masters Spring 2020 &ndash; Europe will take place on Sunday between G2 (France) and BIG (Germany). Two sides will fight for $54,000 prize money and 400 EPT Points, while the second-placed team will earn $28,000 and 265 EPT Points. We have to highlight the fact that this match will be played Best of 5, but G2 will have a 1-0 map advantage due to coming from the upper bracket.</p><p><h3>G2 Team Stats and Latest Results</h3></p><p>G2 (#2 World Rank) comes into this match as massive favorites, after reaching the Grand final through the Upper Bracket with wins over #1 Natus Vincere (2-0) and #24 BIG (2-1) in the Upper final. It means these two teams will meet for the second time at the DreamHack Masters Spring 2020 - Europe tournament. They narrowly won the top spot in Group A thanks to round difference to earn a place in the Upper Bracket with two wins out of three matches. G2 are in a fine form after four victories in the last five games.</p><p>When it comes to maps, G2 are the most successful at Nuke (62.8 winning percentage on 113 times played), while they are also good at Dust2 (61.6%, 198 times played). On the other hand, the French team is weakest at Mirage (50%, 124 times played) and Overpass (50.7%, 148 times played). G2&rsquo;s current lineup consists of: JaCkz (1.03 Rating), huNter- (1.14), kennyS (1.14), AmaNEk (1.06), and nexa (1.08). This lineup played together on 150 occasions since October 2019 and has a record of 89 wins and 61 losses.</p><p><h3>BIG Team Stats and Latest Results</h3></p><p>BIG (#24) enter this match as big underdogs, even though they upset the favored #7 FaZe Clan in the Consolidation final. They were particularly impressive on the opening map (Nuke) and destroyed the opponents 16-4. FaZe Clan were on the brink of exit late on the second map (Mirage) but managed to come from a 15-11 deficit to force overtime. However, BIG were better in double OT and secured a 22-19 win to make it 2-0. BIG was dominant in Group B and won all three matches before they beat FaZe Clan (2-0) and lost to G2 in the Upper Final.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Germans will be looking for revenge after losing that match. They won three of the last five matches and were on a 6-game winning streak before losing to #36 Sprout (0-2) some two weeks ago. When it comes to the maps, BIG are the most successful at Dust2 (62.9%, 97 times played) and Vertigo (62.7%, 16 times played), while they are the weakest at Overpass (48.1%, 108 times played). BIG&rsquo;s current lineup consists of: tabseN (1.07 Rating), tiziaN (0.98), syrsoN (1.09), XANTARES (1.19), and k1to (1.07). This lineup played together on 125 occasions since January 2020 and has a record of 86 wins and 39 losses.</p><p><h3>G2 vs. BIG H2H Record</h3></p><p>As I already mentioned above, these two teams have met at this tournament, and G2 won 2-1. The rivals played Nuke (G2), Dust2 (BIG), and Mirage (G2), and interestingly, all three of the maps were decided by a comfortable margin (16-5, 6-16, 16-7). In total, G2 and BIG met three times, and G2 won all three encounters, while they currently have a 5-1 map lead.</p><p><h3>G2 vs. BIG Betting Preview</h3></p><p>BIG showed they are no pushovers at this tournament after defeating FaZe in the previous round when nobody expected them to get such an easy win. Also, they already took one map against G2 at the DreamHack Masters Spring 2020 &ndash; Europe, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they win at least one map in this one.</p><p>Given that the odds on G2 to win are quite low (-286), backing the underdogs at +350 could be tempting, especially after the performance BIG displayed at this tournament. While that pick is a longshot, I am going with Over 3.5 maps, because I am sure BIG will not give up without a fight, like it was the case in the latest H2H duel. I am backing XANTARES to have another big match following his heroics in a win over FaZe.</p><p><h3>The Pick: Over 3.5 Maps (-200 @ Bet365)</h3></p><p><strong>Additional Pick:</strong> Only for the brave bettors, try with BIG&rsquo;s win at excellent +350 odds (Bet365), as they surely have the talent to make another upset and take the first prize. After losing each of the previous three matches against G2, it&rsquo;s the proper occasion for them to book the first-ever win over the French side.</p><p><a href="https://statsalt.com/articles/g2-vs-big-preview-prediction-free-614-csgo-betting-picks__ca+1325" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>For a second opinion on this contest, visit here.</strong></em></a></p>
