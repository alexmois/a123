                        <p>It&rsquo;s not often that WWE will present pay-per-views in back-to-back weeks but here we are. Last week it was Summer Slam and this week it will be Payback. This should be a fun event as it will see the return of Roman Reigns and we will also witness the first official match of Keith Lee as a part of the main roster. It has been a bit better now that the WWE has moved their events to the Thunderdome and have added virtual fans. It is a great experience for all. Let&rsquo;s get to all the action.</p><p><strong>Odds Are Courtesy Of</strong> <a href="http://www.betonline.ag"><strong>Betonline.ag</strong></a><br /><br /></p><p><br /><strong>The Riott Squad vs. The IIconics (No Odds For This Match)</strong></p><p>This match will be a part of the Kick-ooff Show. The Riott Squad used to rule the women&rsquo;s division but then they split after Ruby Riott got injured. Sara Logan is no longer on the roaster and Liv Morgan went on to be a single&rsquo;s competitor. When Ruby came back, she didn&rsquo;t like the new persona that Liv had and she turned on her former best friend. The two had a few matches against each other but they are now back together and appear to be on the same page. The IIconics have been stirring the pot between the two and they have had some matches against Morgan and Riott with mixed results. Now it all comes to a head for these four women and it should be a good fight to kick off the show. Will the Riott Squad stay on the same page for this one? I think they can. <strong>Prediction: Riott Squad</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Big E (-400) vs. Sheamus (+250)</strong></p><p>The New Day has been one of the most dominant tag teams of the modern era but what was once a team of three, is now down to a team of one. Big E is left as Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods are both on the shelf and he is looking to build up wins and grab his first shot at a major title in Over 11 years. That sounds familiar as it took Kofi over 11 years to get his shot and when he did, he cashed in to win the WWE Title. Can Big E do the same? We shall see. First, he must get past Sheamus, who doesn&rsquo;t feel that Big E will be able to make it as a singles competitor. The two got into a heated confrontation on an episode of Talking Smack and they will now look to solve things in the ring tonight. This will be a very physical match as these are two of the strongest men on the roster. I feel that WWE is trying to give Big E a push and a win over Shaemus would aid that plan greatly. <strong>Prediction: Big E (-400)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Matt Riddle (-170) vs. King Corbin (+130)</strong></p><p>A couple of months ago, Matt Riddle made the transition from NXT to the main roster and he has rubbed a few of the wrestlers the wrong way. One was AJ Styles, who Riddle did beat and another has been Patrick Corbin or King Corbin as he likes to be called after winning the King Of The Ring Tournament. Corbin doesn&rsquo;t like the fact that Riddle is up with the main roster and so he has put out a King&rsquo;s Ransom for any wrestler that would take Riddle down. Shorty G stepped up and tried to do just that but he was beaten this past week on Smackdown by the Original Bro. Matt Riddle likes to have a good time but he really brings it in the ring and as good as Corbin is, I don&rsquo;t see Riddle losing this match. It is his time for a push and a big win over King Corbin will help in a big way. <strong>Prediction: Matt Riddle (-170)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Dominik & Rey Mysterio (-225) vs. Seth Rollins & Murphy (+160)</strong></p><p>Before I get to breaking down this match, I hope that this is the end of the feud as it has been going on for far too long. Seth Rollins is the Monday night Messiah and he feels that everything he has been doing has been to better Monday Night Raw but Rey Mysterio did not want to fall in line. Seth and Rey had a battle that concluded with an eye-for-an-eye match, which Seth won. Rey was put out of commission for a few weeks and in that time, his son Dominik stepped up in an attempt to avenge his father. The younger Mysterio then had an altercation with Seth and Murphy and he was beaten badly with Kendo Sticks. It was a horrible sight. Dominik faced Seth last week at Summer Slam in a street fight in what was his first official match with the company. Rey was at ringside but he promised his son he would not get involved. Seth wound up winning and now we have this match a week later. Rey is competing with just one good eye and Dominik is still a bit green, but the two should be able to exact a measure of revenge against Seth and Murphy in this one. It should be a very good match and one I am excited to see. <strong>Prediction: Rey & Dominik Mysterio (-220)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />United States Champion Match - Apollo Crews (+200) vs. Bobby Lashley (-300)</strong></p><p>This one should be a hard-hitting battle as both of these men are very powerful. Apollo Crews has been given a push by the WWE and he has run with it, taking his first title with the Company. Last week at Summer Slam, he took on MVP for the Title and was victorious in what was a very good match. Now he has to go through another member of the Hurt Business if he hopes to keep his title. Bobby Lashly is one of the most powerful men in the business while Apollo Crews is one of the most physically gifted. Because of his strength, Lashley does pose a different challenge than the one that Crews had last week against MVP and for that reason, I feel that he reign as champion will come to an end on this night. Lashley is just too strong for Crews to be able to handle in this one, plus Lashley has the added advantage of having both MVP and Shelton Benjamin on the outside of the ring. Last week, both Lashley and Benjamin were banned from ringside for his match against MVP. All the advantages are on the side of Lashley in this one. <strong>Prediction: Bobby Lashley (-300)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Keith Lee (-170) vs Randy Orton (+130)</strong></p><p>Last week at NXT Takeover, Keith Lee lost his NXT Title to Karrion Kross and on the following Monday, he was promoted to the main roster. On his first night, Lee came out when Randy Orton was in the ring and challenged him to a fight. Orton walked out but the fight has been made official for tonight. Keith Lee is a fan favorite and it was huge for NXT when he dethroned Adam Cole to take the NXT Title a few months ago. He is a big boy and so I do not expect him to be intimidated by Orton in this one. Randy does have many titles in his career and he has put some of the big names out of commission in his time with WWE but Lee did not blink when he was in the ring against Brock Lesnar at the Royal Rumble in January. I feel that Lee will have a great career up here with the main roster and what better way to kick things off than a win over the Viper, who lost in a WWE Title Match last week against Drew McIntyre. Keith Lee is the favorite in his first official match on the Main roster against one of the best that the company has ever seen and that should tell you all you need to know about this match. <strong>Prediction: Keith Lee (-170)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>WWE Women&rsquo;s Tag Team Championship Match - Bayley & Sasha Banks (+130) vs. Shayna Baszler & Nia Jax (-170)</strong></p><p>Shayna Baszler and Nia Jax on the same team? That is a match made in Hell. LOL. When I did my Summer Slam Preview, I had heard rumors of Asuka and Baszler vs Banks and Bayley but the WWE went a different direction. The one constant, though, is that the cracks are beginning to show between Bayley and Banks. Last week at Summer Slam, the Golden Role Models each had singles matches vs Asuka. Bayley won with the help of Sasha but Banks lost her title and Bayley did not step up to help her. She actually moved out of the way when it could have helped Banks. The Tag Champs still say they are on the same page but those that have been watching, see the foundations crumbling between the pair. Shayna Baszler is one of the most vicious female wrestlers on the roster while Nia Jax is one of the most powerful. Nia and Baszler have their own issues but they have put them aside to take down the Tag Champs in this one. I see the newly formed team taking down Banks and Bayley, whose friendship will erode completely. That will set up a title match between Banks and Bayley down the line while at the same time creating some confusion for the future of the new champs as they are still in the running for Asuka&rsquo;s title. This one match will shake up the women&rsquo;s division and that can only be good for the WWE. <strong>Prediction: Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler (-170)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Universal Championship Match &ldquo;The Fiend&rdquo; Bray Wyatt (+150) vs. Roman Reigns (-250) vs. &ldquo;The Monster&rdquo; Braun Strowman (+550) - (No Holds Barred Triple Threat Match)</strong></p><p>First I have to say that I have been a huge Roman Reigns fan for years, but I am not sure that I will like him as a heel and I am definitely sure that I will not like him as a Paul Heyman guy. This past Friday, Roman signed the contract for this match and he did so with Heyman by his side. Reign has been out for the past few months as he has recovered from Leukemia and that makes him vulnerable to COVID-19. The virus is still going around but the WWE has been very careful and so Reigns felt it was safe to come back and he did so in a big way by spearing The Fiend last week after he had just won the Universal Title from Braun Stroman. Oh and speaking of Stroman, he will be involved in this &ldquo;No Holds Barred Triple Threat Match&rdquo; as well but I do not see him winning back his title. Stroman had his run and now I see a battle between Roman, who never lost his title, and the Fiend Bray Wyatt for the next few months. Wyatt had lost his title to Bill Goldberg and then Braun won it from Goldberg. Bray and Braun have had some battles over the last few months and now we inject the Big Dog into the picture. Could Bray lose his title that quickly after winning it? This is the toughest match to predict, I feel but I will go with Bray to keep his title, but he may lose it to Roman somewhere down the line. <strong>Prediction: The Fiend (+150) </strong></p>
