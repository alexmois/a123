                        <p>Super Bowl 57 Prop Bets</p><p>Super LVII (57) is nearly here as the Philadelphia Eagles meet the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, Feb. 12 at 6:30pmET from Glendale, Arizona. Prop bets are thrown out all the time by people who might watch football once a season or gamble on the team who has the meanest-sounding nickname.</p><p>Our Senior Editor Ben Hayes and Associate Editor Mark Ruelle have compiled their Top 20 Super Bowl props based on their decades of experience picking football winners and quality prop bets.</p><p>(prop bets from BetMGM and DraftKings)</p><p><h3 class="MsoNormal">Top 20 Super Bowl Props</h3></p><p><strong><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/1">by Ben Hayes</a></strong></p><p><strong>1)Travis Kelce First Touchdown of the Game +650</strong></p><p>The Chiefs' tight end is one of the greatest to ever play his position. He already has 21 catches for 176 yards and 3 TDs in 2 playoff games.</p><p><strong>2)Travis Kelce 2 or more touchdowns +310 <br /><br />3)Travis Kelce Anytime in the first half +210</strong></p><p>Best tight end ever from one of the best quarterbacks. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of options for Patrick Mahomes.</p><p><strong>4)Jalen Hurts Under 245.5 -115 Passing Yards</strong></p><p>Hurts hasn&rsquo;t been very sharp in the playoffs. He&rsquo;s thrown for just 275 yards. He&rsquo;ll be running a lot against the Chiefs&rsquo; tough pass rush.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5)Jalen Hurts Interception Over 0.5 +115 </strong></p><p>I get it. Hurts doesn&rsquo;t throw many picks. He had just six in the regular season. But the pressure of the Super Bowl and KC&rsquo;s pressure will force him into a mistake or two.</p><p><strong>6)Jalen Hurts Longest Completion Over 37.5 -115</strong></p><p>Hurts to A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith has been great downfield combinations all year.</p><p><strong>7)Jalen Hurts First Pass Complete? No +160</strong><br /><br />Just looking for good value here and that Hurts might want to take a shot downfield early.</p><p><strong>8)Jalen Hurts Over 48.5 -115 rushing yards</strong></p><p>Hurts will run early and often in this one. He&rsquo;ll be healthier after a week off. He has 760 yards rushing this season.</p><p><strong>9)A.J. Brown Over 71.5 passing yards -115</strong></p><p>Brown can do it all. He has 88 catches for 1,496 yards with 11 TDs and 17 yards per attempt. He&rsquo;s slowed down because the 49ers were spectacular defensively and the Eagles didn&rsquo;t need to take chances in the air.</p><p><strong>10)Kenneth Gainwell Receiving yards Over 12.5 -110 </strong></p><p>Gainwell leads the Eagles in rushing in the postseason with 160 an also has 3 catches for 35 yards.</p><p><strong>11)Kansas City Fourth Down Conversions Over 0.5 +100</strong></p><p>A healthier Patrick Mahomes should help Andy Reid&rsquo;s decision-making here.</p><p><strong>12)Philadelphia Total 4th down Conversions Over 1.6 +160</strong></p><p>A healthy Jalen Hurts gives Nick Sirianni so many options on third and fourth and short.</p><p><strong>13)Miles Sanders Rushing 75+ yards +200</strong></p><p>Sanders was ineffective against the 49ers, but he has 1,269 yards this season with 11 TDs on 4.9ypc.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>14) Isaiah Pacheco Over 52.5 -115 rushing yards</strong></p><p>Pacheco has a chance to make a huge impact in this game with his quickness and power.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>15)Jerick McKinnon Longest rush Over 9.5 -110</strong></p><p>McKinnon is just a playmaker and while he&rsquo;s known more for his receiving, he has 291 yards with a long of 30 this season.</p><p><strong>16)Will both teams score 3 or more points in the first quarter? </strong></p><p><strong>Yes +120</strong></p><p>With two MVP-caliber quarterbacks, I don&rsquo;t these teams shutting each other out.</p><p><strong>17)Special or Defensive Team Touchdown Scored?</strong></p><p><strong>Yes +275</strong></p><p>The Eagles have an incredible pass rush led by Hasson Reddick and Chris Jones is a wrecking machine for the Chiefs. Skyy Moore had the 29-yard punt return that helped the Chiefs win the AFC title game.</p><p><strong>18)Both teams to score 3+ Touchdowns?</strong></p><p><strong>Yes +170 </strong></p><p><strong>19)Total Touchdowns-Exacts</strong></p><p><strong>7 +400</strong></p><p>The Eagles are averaging 28.1 points per game and the Chiefs lead the league in 29.2 points. The Chiefs haven&rsquo;t been as quite as dynamic with Mahomes being hurt, but he&rsquo;ll be close to 100% as will Hurts. The week layoff will help both teams with injured receivers and offensive linemen.</p><p><strong>20)First Drive-Field goal Made</strong></p><p><strong>Yes +475</strong></p><p>Give either quarterback the ball first and they are going to move the ball. It might not be all the way and they may end up getting stuck at around the 30. Harrison Butker and Jake Elliiot are both capable kickers with strong legs.</p><p><h3 class="MsoNormal">Top 20 Super Bowl Props</h3></p><p><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/15">by Mark Ruelle</a></p><p>It is hard to believe we have reached that point again, the biggest sports betting day of the year: Super Bowl Sunday. There will be plenty of first-time bettors, Super Bowl pools, friendly wagers and, more importantly, props aplenty. This year&rsquo;s game will feature two of the NFL&rsquo;s more dynamic quarterbacks and stars on both sides of the ball as the Philadelphia Eagles get set to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>While there are props far and wide-reaching, I&rsquo;m going to list my Top-25 props that will focus solely on game play. Without further ado, here is this year&rsquo;s list.</p><p><strong>1)MVP<br />Take Jalen Hurts +120</strong></p><p>The #1 Prop Play, we have to focus on the game&rsquo;s MVP. Here are my Top 5 candidates and then I&rsquo;ll give you the pick: Jalen Hurts +120, Patrick Mahomes +130, AJ Brown +1000, Travis Kelce +1000 and Miles Sanders +2200</p><p>This one likely comes down to the two quarterbacks. Unless either Kelce or Brown has a multi-touchdown game, both teams will only go as far as their quarterbacks take them. I have leaned heavily on Jalen Hurts in many of these props so I&rsquo;m sticking with him here. If you want to be adventurous, Brown is a tantalizing option.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>2)Rushing Attempts in the game.</strong><br /><strong>Take the over Hurts rushes 10.5 +110</strong></p><p>The odds were fairly modest in this category but I noticed Jalen Hurts rushing line to my liking. He will get a few sneaks, he will break out and run and there will be designed runs for sue. He will sail past this total.</p><p><strong>3)Receptions in the game<br />Take Goedert under 4.5 catches +110</strong></p><p>Scanning the list, the best odds fell on Eagles TE Dallas Goedert. I think Hurts will make the majority of his throws down the field to wideouts and will be more likely to take off and run than dump it down to Goedert. The under looks promising with Goedert.</p><p><strong>4)Receiving Yards A.J. Brown<br />Take Brown receiving yards over 100 yards +230</strong></p><p>The Chiefs secondary will give up plays and I&rsquo;m convinced Brown will be the focal point for Hurts. Good line listed for a big day for the Eagles star receiver.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>5) 2+ touchdowns in the game<br />Take Jalen Hurts 2+ Touchdowns +700</strong></p><p>I keep coming back to this being Jalen Hurts absolute coming out party. Healthy and ready to go, he&rsquo;ll find the end zone at least twice with good odds.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>6)Any time TD Scorer<br />Take JuJu Smith-Schuster Any Time TD Scorer +255</strong></p><p>Lost in the shuffle as of late has been Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster. The veteran receiver has had a strong first season in KC but has been quiet in the playoffs. Smith-Schuster is a nice option at a good price to haul in a score.</p><p><strong>7)First TD Scorer<br />Take A.J. Brown First TD Scorer +950</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m expecting a big game out of A.J. Brown after a subpar playoffs thus far. Here&rsquo;s a chance to make a nice chunk of change on a top player scoring the opening touchdown.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>8)Chiefs Total Points: 31-40 +330<br />Take Chiefs Total points 31-40 +330</strong></p><p>Kansas City has proven time and time again that they will not go away. They will put up numbers to match the Eagles here. The Chiefs have scored 30 or more points in four of the five games they played in domes this season.</p><p><strong>9)Eagles Total Points: 31-40 +290<br />Take Eagles Total points 31-40 +290</strong></p><p>The Eagles have scored over 30 points in each of their two playoff games and Hurts should be even healthier in this spot.</p><p><strong>10)Eagles Total 4th Down Conversions: Over 1.5 +160 Under 1.5 -200<br />Take the Over 1.5 4th Down Conversions +160</strong></p><p>Nick Sirianni hasn&rsquo;t been bashful going for it on fourth down this season and won&rsquo;t be with the Super Bowl on the line. I would be surprised if the Eagles didn&rsquo;t go for it at least four times in this game.</p><p><strong>11)KC Chiefs Total 4th Down Conversions: Over .5 +100 Under .5 -120<br /></strong><strong>Take the Over .5 4th Down Conversions +100</strong></p><p>Welcome to the new NFL where analytics reign supreme. Andy Reid may be one of the oldest coaches but he has always been comfortable going for it with this offense.</p><p><strong>12)Eagles Total Rushing Touchdowns: Over 1.5 +120 Under 1.5 -150<br />Take the Over 1.5 Rushing Touchdowns +120</strong></p><p>This looks like a solid play to the over. The Eagles had 32 touchdowns on the ground this season and have added seven rushing touchdowns in the playoffs.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>13)Jalen Hurts Rushing Yards: 25 -1400 50 -135 75 +225 100 +600<br />Hurts Over 75 yards rushing +600</strong></p><p>Hurts has looked stronger and stronger running the ball in the playoffs. Money to be made at 75 yards and, if you are feeling extra confident, try him at 100 yards for a big score.</p><p><strong>14)Isiah Pacheco Rushing Yards: 25 -1200 50 -135 75 +225 100 +600<br />Pacheco Over 75 yards rushing +600</strong></p><p>While 100 yards would be ambitious, 75 yards might be worth a play at +225. The Chiefs will try to mute the Chiefs' pass rush and might do that will the run. The Eagles are just 16th against the run.</p><p><strong>15)Pass/Rushing Yards Combined Jalen Hurts: Over 298.5 Under 298.5<br />Hurts Over 298.5 combined yards</strong></p><p>Hurts will need to be at his best for the Eagles to have a chance and 300 yards combined seems like a reasonable proposition.</p><p><strong>16)Each Team to Score 1+ Touchdown in Each Half & Each Team to Score 1+ Field Goal in Each Half: Yes +1100 No -3500</strong></p><p><strong>Yes +1100</strong></p><p>Two high-powered offenses on a fast track in Arizona should mean plenty of scoring in both halves. They won&rsquo;t be perfect in the red zone, however, so yes is a solid play.</p><p><strong>17) Total Sack totals for the Eagles: Over 2.5 -140 Under 2.5 +115<br />Under +115</strong></p><p>The Eagles are the first d-line to have four players with double-digit sacks but, keep in mind, Mahomes will be two weeks along in his recovery. There&rsquo;s money to be had in the under.</p><p><strong>18)Total Sack totals for the Chiefs: Over 2.5 -110 Under 2.5 -110<br />Under -110</strong></p><p>Hurts is tough to take down and the Chiefs will be wary of the RPO so the under is a good play.</p><p><strong>19)Which team will score the most touchdowns: Chiefs -135 Eagles +115 Tie +425<br />Tie +425</strong></p><p>In converting red zone opportunities into touchdowns, the two teams are ranked 2nd and third in the NFL. In a game I think could be tight, there is money to be made in the tie line with a game decided by a field goal.</p><p><strong>20) Which team will score the first touchdown: Chiefs +210 Eagles +185<br />Eagles +185</strong></p><p>These are two of the better-scoring teams in the NFL, ranking fourth and fifth on the season in first-quarter points. I like the Eagles in this spot, averaging 10 first-quarter points in their last three games.</p><p><em>There you have it, my prop favorites for Super Bowl LXVII.
