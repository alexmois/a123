                        <p>The NFL Draft is over and now we can have some fun with looking ahead to the upcoming NFL season. Whether it starts in September or October, whether it has games on Saturday throughout the season or not, it should be a good season overall. The Ravens and Chiefs seem to be the class of the league right now but don&rsquo;t forget about the 49ers or the Saints, plus tye Vikings had a tremendous draft and Tampa Bay now had Tom Brady. Other teams have also improved like Arizona, the Colts, the Bills, and the Cowboys. This upcoming season should be a wild ride, even if the game will be played with no fans or even half-empty stadiums. Today, I will be taking a look at my Top 10 NFL Props for the upcoming season. I will countdown from 10 to my Number one prop.</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-face2229-7fff-f664-3822-f15308db7dbe"></strong></p><p><strong>10) Vikings To Make The Playoffs Yes (-125)... No (+105)</strong></p><p>I have two favorite teams in the NFL. The Los Angeles Chargers and the Minnesota Vikings. I am not playing this prop just because the Vikes are one of my favorite teams, but because they had an amazing draft while the packers had the worst draft in the league. That should be enough to push the Vikings to the NFC North title and a spot in the postseason. Minnesota has a strong offense and their defense will be much improved. Look for them to go at least 11-5. <strong>Prediction: Minnesota, Yes To Make The Playoffs (-125)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />9) Julian Edelman Total Receiving Touchdowns Over/Under 4.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>The Patriots do not have Tom Brady anymore and that could make it tough for Julian Edelman to reach five TDs this year. Still, I feel that he will. Edleman has had six receiving touchdowns or more in four of his last six years and I see him getting at least five this year. The Pats did not draft a top-notch receiver this year and while they did grab Marquise Lee in the offseason, Edelman is still the main guy and will be relied on heavily to get the team in the endzone. I also look for Jarrett Stidham to have a better than expected season, which will help Edelman&rsquo;s numbers. <strong>Prediction: Julian Edelman Over 4.5 Receiving Touchdowns (-110).</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />8) Aaron Rodgers Total Passing Yards Over/Under 3849.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>Aaron Rodgers has to be a bit pissed after the front office failed to get him some help in the wide receiving corps. The packers did not draft a single wide receiver this year and that that leaves them with just Devante Adams as their primary guy. He had 997 yards receiving last year while the no one else had more than 477 yards. This team may have one of the worst WR corps in the league. Aaron Rodgers is good and he has thrown for over 4000 yards many times in his career, but he will not make it to 3850 yards this year. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the weapons and with the drafting of AJ Dillon, the packers may be looking to run the ball a bit more, which will take away some of his passing yards as well. <strong>Prediction: Aaron Rodgers Under 3849.5 Yards Passing (-110)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />7) Christian McCaffery Total Rushing Yards Over/ Under 1249.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>The Carolina Panthers did not help the offense at all in the draft as all of their picks were on the defensive side of the ball. They also lost TE Greg Olsen. The Panthers do have DJ Moore at WR but still, the offense will run through Christian McCaffery. He had 1387 yards rushing last year and I see him putting up at least 1300 yards on the ground this year. No one else on the team had more than 130 yards rushing last year. The offense will rely on him a ton this year, especially since they did not go out and get much help for the offense. <strong>Prediction: Christian McCaffery Total Rushing Yards Over 1249.5 (-110)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>6) NFC South Winner - Buccaneers +150... Falcons +600&hellip; Panthers +1100&hellip; Saints -105</strong></p><p>The Saints won the division title by a landslide last year but it will be a much closer race this year. I like them to win the division but the Tampa Bay Bucs have really closed the gap. Still, the Saints are the team to beat and they even improved themselves a bit with a good draft. Cesar Ruiz upgrades the offensive line and zack Braun will be a big help on the defensive side of the ball. The receiving corps was also upgraded (didn&rsquo;t know it was possible) with the addition of Emmanuel Sanders. The Saints won the division by six games and while it won&rsquo;t be that easy this year, they will do enough to keep the Buccaneers at bay and win their 4th division title in a row. <strong>Prediction: New Orleans Saints -105</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />5) NFC West Division Winner - 49ers -115&hellip; Cardinals +600&hellip; Rams +500&hellip; Seahawks +250</strong></p><p>The NFC West is an improved division all the way around and that means this race should be very close all year. Still, I feel it will turn out just last year and that means the 49ers will win it. San Fran went 13-3 last year and they have most of their team back. The Niners did lose WR Emmanuel Sanders but they still have George Kittle and have added Brandon Aiyuk in the 1st round of the draft. The defense will also be improved with the Addition of DT Javon Kinlaw. The Cards are improved and so are the Rams while the Seahawks should be solid one again but the Niners are still the team to beat in this division as they are the most complete team from top to bottom. <strong>Prediction: San Francisco 49ers -115.</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />4) George Kittle Total Receiving Yards Over/ Under 1099.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>Back in 2017, George Kittle had 1377 yards receiving. Last year, he had 1053 yards but played in just 14 games. I see him hitting the Over in this prop. Yes, they added Travis Benjamin but he has not had more than 677 yards in each of his last four years. They also added WR Brandon Aiyuk in the first round but he is just a rookie and will take some time to get up to speed. George Kittle is still their main threat in the passing game and I see him putting up at least 1200 yards receiving on the year. <strong>Prediction: George Kittle Total Receiving Yards Over 1099.5 (-110)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />3) Philip Rivers Total Passing Yards Over/ Under 3999.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>This should be nearly a slam dunk. Rivers left my Bolts for the Colts and I will look for him not to miss a beat. Indy struggled in the passing game last year but Rivers has thrown for at least 4286 yards in each of his last seven years and at least 4009 yards in 11 of his last 12. Rivers has averaged 4381.9 yards in his last 12 seasons. Yes, the Bolts have had some good receivers but Indy does have Ty Hilton, who had a bad year a season ago but he has also had some huge years when Andrew Luck was at QB. Rivers will get him the ball a lot, plus the colts upgraded their WR corps by drafting Michael Pittman from USC. Overall, the Colts have a good receiving corp and now they have a QB that can get them the Damn Ball. Prediction: <strong>Philip Rivers Over 3999.5 Yards passing (-110).</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />2) Tom Brady Total Passing Yards Over/ Under 3999.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>Tom Brady is off to Tampa Bay and I feel that he should be able to easily hit the 4000-yard passing mark. Jameis Winston threw for 5109 yards in this offense last year and Brady is far better than he is. Last year, Tom threw for 4057 yards with the Patriots and that was with a patchwork receiving corps. This year, he will have Rob Gronkowski, along with Chris Goodwin (1333 yards last year) and Mike Evans (1157 yards, plus they added WR Tyler Johnson in the draft and he will be a surprise in the league. Tom has passed for over 4000 yards in 10 of his last 11 full years and he will do so again. <strong>Prediction: Tom Brady Total Passing Yards Over 3999.5 (-110)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br /><br />1) Kyler Murray Total Yards Passing Over/Under 3899.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>This is my top prop for the upcoming season. Kyler Murray threw for 3722 yards last year and that earned him the title of Offensive Rookie Of The Year. Now he is in his 2nd year and I see him eclipsing the 4000-yard mark. Murry threw for a ton of years with a poor offensive line but that was taken care of in the offseason, especially with the drafting of Tristan Wirfs. Arizona has also added Deandre Hopkins, who had 1165 yards receiving last year and has had at least that many receiving yards in five of his seven seasons so far. Murray also still has Larry Fitzgerald (804 yards last year) and Christian Kirk (709 yards). Murray will have a huge year. <strong>Prediction: Over 3899.5 Yards (-110) </strong></p>
