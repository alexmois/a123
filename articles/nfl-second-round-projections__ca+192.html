                        <p><h4>Second Round Projections</h4></p><p><strong>33)Cincinnati Bengals -Edge Zack Baun, Wisconsin</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a no-brainer for the Bengals. They need an edge rusher and while Baun had some issues with a drug test, he's worth taking a shot on in the second round. Lack of size for an edge rusher is a concern at 6-2 238, though would play more of an outside linebacker. Had 12.5 sacks and is strong against the run.</p><p><strong>34)Indianapolis Colts (from Washington). WR Michael Pittman, USC</strong></p><p>Comments: Colts need a receiver and a quarterback for the future. Pittman is too good to pass up as T.Y. Hilton is the only receiver who has been productive and is 31, coming off an injury-plagued season. Pittman is a big receiver at 6-4, 222 with average speed. He can get deep and just overpower DBs with his size. Does well to pick up yards after contact.</p><p><strong>35)Detroit Lions, DE A.J. Espenesa, Iowa</strong></p><p>Comments. Another solid defensive pick for the Lions, who got Jeff Okudah in the first round. Espenesa had first-round talent and at 6-5, 275, has good size for a defensiv end. Not very explosive, but solid player who was prouctive with 21.5 sacks over his last two seasons at Iowa.</p><p><strong>36)New York Giants, S Xavier McKinney, Alabama</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a steal. The Giants do need a safety and they got the best one in the draft. Nobody chose a safety in the first round and it's not a very glamorous position. But McKinney is an excellent value pick, but also a need as Jabril Peppers is coming off a season-ending injury. Has great instincts and plays the run very well.</p><p><strong>37)New England Patriots (from Chargers), DE Yetur Gross-Matos, Penn State</strong></p><p>Comments: Patriots traded out of the first round and some thought they would grab Gross-Matos with the 23rd pick in the first round. A bit shocking that he would be still around. He has decent size at 6-5, 266 and should be able to set the edge against the run. Had 9.5 sacks last year with Penn State and still has room for growth as a player. This would make some sense.</p><p><strong>38)Carolina Panthers, CB Trevon Diggs, Alabama</strong></p><p>Comments: The Panthers took a defensive tackle in the first round with Derrick Brown. Diggs was thought to be a first-round selection, but got surpassed. Good size at 6-1, 205 and younger brother of Stefon Diggs. Could also be a return specialist. Concerns about him playing corner just a year-and-a-half and might be more of a safety.</p><p><strong>39)Miami Dolphins, RB De'Andre Swift, Georgia</strong></p><p>Comments: Miami needs everything right now so why not take the best running back in the draft? If Swift goes here, he will be behind Clyde Edwards-Helaire. Swift is more explosive and can also run routes. Comes from one of the best programs for running backs in the nation.</p><p><strong>40)Houston Texans (from Arizona), WR Denzel Mims, Baylor</strong></p><p>Comments: This is the De'Andre Hopkins pick from Arizona. They could also go with Tee Higgins, but Mims is better value here. Mims has better speed at 6-3, 207 than Higgins. Probably needs to add a little more size. Baylor receivers usually need to work on their route running.</p><p><strong>41)Cleveland Browns, S Antoine Winfield Jr., Minnesota</strong></p><p>Comments: Winfield is a ball hawk whose father was a first-round pick in 1999 for Buffalo. Winfield is 5-9, 205, so he lacks size for a safety, but he is sturdy. Very aggressive run defender.</p><p><strong>42)Jacksonville Jaguars, WR Tee Higgins, Clemson</strong></p><p>Comments: Jags need a lot. Higgins is a good route runner with good size at 6-4, 216. Doesn't have great speed, but is faster on the field. Not great after the catch, but he can get open and should be a possession receiver that can go vertical. Had 25 TDs over his last two seasons at Clemson.</p><p><strong>43)Chicago Bears (from Raiders). S Grant Delpit, LSU</strong></p><p>Comments: Another first-round talent slips because the position is not considered that important. Eddie Jackson is elite but Ha Ha Clinton Dix is gone to Dallas. Delpit had tackling issues in 2019 and part of that could be due to a collarbone injury he suffered in 2018. Very good size at 6-3, 213 and speed at 4.5 in the 40.</p><p><strong>44)Indianapolis Colts, QB Jalen Hurts, Oklahoma</strong></p><p>Comments: This is a pretty good spot to take Hurts, who is a great runner, but still raw as a quarterback. Showed a lot of improvement at Oklahoma last season. With Philip Rivers in the fold, he can sit a year or two, unless they decide to use him in certain packages, which is possible since Rivers has zero mobility.</p><p><strong>45)Tampa Bay Buccaneers, S Jeremy Chinn, Southern Illinois</strong></p><p>Comments: Chinn might be the first FCS player taken, but he's a risk. Tampa Bay had all sorts of issues in the secondary last season. Chinn is a beast at 6-3, 221 with a 4.45 40. A strong tackler who might need a season to get adjusted to all the speed, but he has a chance to be a solid starter, if not better.</p><p><strong>46)Denver Broncos, OT Ezra Cleveland, Boise State</strong></p><p>Comments: Denver stole Jerry Jeudy at 15 in the first round. Now they'll look to replace Garrett Bolles, who had 34 holding calls over the last three years. Drew Lock does need some protection and Cleveland is a very athletic tackle at 6-6, 311. He ran a 4.93 40, which is fast for a big guy. His athleticism will hopefully make up for his short arms. Has good feet and toughness.</p><p><strong>47)Atlanta Falcons, RB J.K. Dobbins, Ohio State</strong></p><p>Comments: Falcons took cornerback A.J. Terrell from Clemson in the first round. They do need a runner here and Dobbins fits the bill at 5-9.5, 10 with a 4.45 40. Had 71 catches for 645 yards and 4,469 rushing yards in his career. Needs to improve in pass protection. Can make people miss, which is the first thing these smallish type of backs have to be able to do. Also takes care of the football and is durable.</p><p><strong>48)New York Jets, CB Jaylon Johnson, Utah</strong></p><p>Comments: Was one of my sleepers. Love Johnson though wouldn't be shocked if they go receiver here or trade up to get one. Most of the better receivers will be gone by now. Johnson is good in press coverage and reads the quarterback well. Has average size at 6-0, 193 and decent speed at 4.5 40.</p><p><strong>49)Pittsburgh Steelers, RB Jonathan Taylor, Wisconsin</strong></p><p>Comments: Steelers could use a future quarterback and another receiver. But they struggled in the running game last season. Taylor is 5-10, 225 with a 4.39 40 time. So size and speed are there. Putting the ball on the ground is an issue. If he eliminates that, he could be very good.</p><p><strong>50)Chicago Bears, OG Robert Hunt, Louisiana</strong></p><p>Comments: Bears need some help on the interior of the offensive line. Hunt can play left guard or right tackle. Did both in college about equal time. Shorter arms at 6-5, 323 makes him more of a guard. Has powerful hands and is very competitive.</p><p><strong>51)Dallas Cowboys, DL Ross Blacklock, TCU</strong></p><p>Comments: Jerry Jones went for the splashy pick in CeeDee Lamb at 17. Very good value, but that was not a serious need. Defense needs to be addressed. Blacklock is a bit undersized at 6-3, 290, but is very good against the run. Is quick enough to get to the quarterback and supply some inside pressure.</p><p><strong>52)LA Rams, OLB Terrell Lewis, Alabama.</strong></p><p>Comments: Rams' first pick of the draft. They have another second-rounder coming up at 57. Rams are desperate for linebacking help. Lewis fits the 3-4 scheme at 6-3, 262. Has long arms, very good speed and athleticism. Issues are with durability due to injuries that cost him most of 2017 and all of 2018.</p><p><strong>53)Philadelphia Eagles, LB Malik Harrison, Ohio State</strong></p><p>Comments: Another outside linebacker and another player from Ohio State at 6-3, 247. Harrison struggles in coverage, but can rush the passer. Might not be a three-down player.</p><p><strong>54)Buffalo Bills, DE Marlon Davidson, Auburn</strong></p><p>Comments: The Bills lost Shaq Lawson to Miami and Jerry Hughes is coming off wrist and groin surgeries in the offseason. Davidson is around 6-4, 305 and ran a 5.04 40. Was a four-year starter who can start at DE in the 3-4 or can play DT in the 4-3. Very sturdy against the run and can rush the passer.</p><p><strong>55)Baltimore Ravens (from NE/ATL), OG Damien Lewis, LSU</strong></p><p>Comments: Short guard at 6-2, 327 without much length. But very good run blocker and strong finsher. Ravens need a potential starter at guard. Needs some work in pass protection. Ravens need a right guard thanks to the retirement of Marshall Yanda.</p><p><strong>56)Miami Dolphins (from NO), S Kyle Dugger, Lenoir-Rhyne</strong></p><p>Comments: Very athletic safety from a D2 school. Very good range and ran a 4.49 40 at 6-1, 217. Playmaker with the ball in his hands. Negatives are his age (24) and coming from a non-D1 school.</p><p><strong>57)LA Rams (from Houston), RB Cam Akers, Florida State</strong></p><p>Comments: Akers is very underrated. Maybe because he played for a bad FSU team. Has decent size at 5-10, 217 and good speed. He might not be Todd Gurley in his prime, but he's a nice replacement in the second round</p><p><strong>58)Minnesota Vikings, DT Jordan Elliott, Missouri</strong></p><p>Comments: Vikes go for defense here with a 6-4, 320-pounder from Missouri. Not a big pass rusher, but very mobile for his size. Solid value pick.</p><p><strong>59)Seattle Seahawks, OT Josh Jones, Houston</strong></p><p>Comments: Jones received a first-round grade from some, so good value here. A four-year starter at left tackle. A 6-5, 319 he has good guard size. Not very good length, which may inhibit him from playing tackle. Could also end up with the Ravens at one of their second-round picks, if they think he can play guard. Could end being a swing guy off the bench.</p><p><strong>60)Baltimore Ravens, WR Laviska Shenault, Colorado</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens could take another Notre Dame receiver in Chase Claypool. But Shenalt is one of those playmakers who has good size at 6-1, 227 and has the ability to make people miss. Not a burner, though may remind some people of Anquan Boldin, which is not a bad thing (an ex-Raven).</p><p><strong>61)Tennessee Titans, WR Chase Claypool, Notre Dame.</strong></p><p>Comments:Another big Notre Dame receiver at 6-4, 238. May end up at tight end, though he does have 4.42 speed. The problem for him is getting open, beacuse he's more of a straight line runner and has very little wiggle.</p><p><strong>62)Green Bay Packers, TE Cole Kmet, Notre Dame</strong></p><p>Comments: If they don't go receiver or tight end, Aaron Rodgers could ask for a trade. Kmet is the best tight end in the draft at 6-6, 262 with a 4.7 40. Very good arm length and big hands. Solid blocker. But lack of speed means he's mainly a red zone target and a first-down machine. Did have 43 catches for 515 yards with 6 TDs last year.</p><p><strong>63)Kansas City Chiefs (from 49ers), CB Amik Robertson, Louisiana Tech</strong></p><p>Comments: Chiefs went offense with their first pick and all of their weaknesses are on defense. Robertson could play the nickel spot right away with his cover skills and toughness.</p><p><strong>64)Seattle Seahawks (from Chiefs), Edge Darrell Taylor, Tennessee</strong></p><p>Comments: Is Jadeveon Clowney returning? Probably not. Taylor had seven sacks last season and runs a 4.65 40 at 6-4, 267. Can play 3-4 OLB or DE. Should fit well as a 4-3 end.</p>
