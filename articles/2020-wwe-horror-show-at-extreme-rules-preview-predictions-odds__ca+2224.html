                        <p>It has been a little over five weeks since the last WWE PPV and it will be another five weeks until we get to the next PPV, which is Summer Slam. Sandwiched in between is Horror Show at Extreme Rules, which will take place at WWE Performance Center in Orlando Florida. This should be a good fun show with four titles on the line. Well, let&rsquo;s get to all the action.</p><p><br />Odds Are Courtesy Of <a href="https://mybookie.ag/sportsbook/wrestling/#accordionBets1008">MyBookie.com</a></p><p><br /><strong>United States Title Match: MVP (+300) vs Apollo Crews (-500)</strong></p><p>This one has been brewing for a few weeks and it should be a good match. Apollo Crews has a new attitude and some new entrance music, which he parlayed into being the United States Champion. Since winning the title on May 25th he faced Kevin Owens for the title, which ended as a no contest. Then on the Backlash kickoff show, he successfully defended against Andrade. This match will be a tough one, as he is facing MVP, who recently returned to the WWE. MVP is a tough cookie to face but what will make this match very tough is the fact that MVP has a very dangerous Bobby Lashley in his corner. Montel Vontavious Porter has won the U.S. Title twice in his career, with the last time coming back in 2012. He hasn&rsquo;t done a whole lot since his return to the WWE, except being the manager for Lashley. For Crews, this is his first title reign in the WWE so far and I do not expect it to be all that short. WWE has been pushing Crews, who is one of the best athletes on the roster. Even though MVP has the edge of having Lashley in his corner, this one will go to Crews. <strong>Prediction: Apollo Crews -500</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong><strong>Smackdown Woman&rsquo;s Title Match: Nikki Cross (+500) vs Bayley (-800)</strong></p><p>I was just as shocked as anyone when Nikki Cross won a Fatal-4-Way match between her Alexa Bliss, Dana Brooke, and Lacey Evans to grab the number. I was also pleasantly surprised as Cross is one of my favorite wrestlers on the women&rsquo;s roster. Cross is a fierce competitor and it is nice to see the WWE give her a bit of a push. She has won the WWE Women&rsquo;s Tag Belts a couple of times with Alexa Bliss but a win in this match would give her a singles title for the first time at the main roster level. Having said all that, it is unlikely that Cross will win this match against the longest reigning Smackdown Women&rsquo;s champion. About a year and a half ago, Bayley changed here image and hair and went full out heel. It was a good move for her as she has been nearly unstoppable since. It also helps that Bayly has Sasha Banks in her corner. Eventually, the two will implode and it will cost Bayley her title. This will not be that time. I just cannot see Nikki Cross win the belt here, as much as I would Cross win her first singles title on the main roster. <strong>Prediction: Bayley -800</strong></p><p><strong><br />Eye For An Eye Match - Rey Mysterio (+110) vs Seth Rollins</strong></p><p>This one should be an all-out war and it could be the most gruesome match of the evening. An Eye-For-An-Eye match is a perfect match for a PPV called the Horror Show and while we will not see anyone&rsquo;s eye actually be pulled from its socket, it should still be a bloody good time. A couple of months ago, Rey Mysterio announced that he will be retiring but Seth and his cronies came out and ruined it. Rollins then went on to try and blind Rey on the corner of one of the steps leading up to the ring. Mysterio was a bloody mess after that event and also missed a few weeks of action. He has been cleared to wrestle a couple of weeks ago and will now be out for revenge. It will not be all that easy as Seth Rollins is a very tough opponent and Seth does have Murphy in his corner. Rollins has been back-and-forth between being a good guy and being a heel. He is now called the Monday Night Messiah and wants the rest of the locker room to fall into his cult. Rey was having none of it and so Seth set out to make an example of him. Rey does have his son, Dominik, at his side and the pair have also gotten help from Aleister Black. Still, I don&rsquo;t think it will be enough for Rey to win this one. Mysterio is looking to retire and what better way to do that than have a career-ending injury, like the loss of an eye. No, he won&rsquo;t really lose his eye, but this does set up perfectly for Rey to call it a career. He will not go out without a fight, though. <strong>Prediction: Seth Rollins -150.</strong></p><p><strong><br />Raw Women&rsquo;s Championship Match - Asuka (-300) vs Sasha Banks (+200)</strong></p><p>This should be a great match between two of the best women wrestlers on the roster. Sasha Banks is the partner of Bayley and the pair are the Women&rsquo;s Tag Title champions. Bayley is also the Smackdown Women&rsquo;s Champion, so she currently owns two belts. Sasha is hoping to have two belts as well and that is why she has challenged Asuka for the Raw Women&rsquo;s Title. Banks will eventually turn on Bayley and that should set up a dynamite rivalry between the pair. For now, she is just hoping to be a dual-champion, just like her best friend, Bayley. I have been a fan of Asuka, since her days back in NXT. She was the woman&rsquo;s champ for a very long time down there and has now won the Raw Woman&rsquo;s title twice while also holding the Smackdown title once. Back at Money in the Bank, Asuka won the briefcase and found out the next night that what was in the briefcase wasn&rsquo;t a contract for a title match at the time and place but it was in fact the title. Becky Lunch had to relinquish the title after finding out she was pregnant. This past week on Raw, Shayna Baszler made her return and I expect that she will be injected into a rivalry with the winner of this match. Can Sasha become &ldquo;Two-Belts Becky&rdquo; Can Asuka fend off the challenge by banks and thus setting up a rivalry between her and Shayna. Asuka and Baszler have been the two longest running champs in the history of NXT and I feel that will be a very solid rivalry here in the main roster. Banks will give it all she has, but it will not be enough as the Empress of the Night will retain her title here. <strong>Prediction: Asuka -300.</strong></p><p><strong><br />Swamp Fight - Bray Wyatt (+105) vs Braun Stroman (-145) (Non-Title Match)</strong></p><p>Just like the Eye for an Eye match between Seth and Rey, this match is aptly named for the Horror Show. The match is called the Swamp Fight and it will be a cinematic match, just like the Boneyard Match between the Undertaker and AJ Styles. Stroma defeated Bray back at Money in the Bank and will look to make it two in a row here. These two are now going back to where it all began, the Swamp. When Bray first came to WWE, he was the leader of the Wyatt Family, which also included Erik Rowan and Luke Harper. Eventually, Stroman was brought in as the Black Sheep of the family. Wyatt then went on his own to form the fiend, who would have also been a nice addition to the Horror Show. Braun finally won his first singles title here in WWE after topping Brock Lesnar back at Wrestlemania and after successfully defending against Bray at Money in the Bank, he went on to have a successful Title defense against The Miz and Morrison at Backlash. Now &ldquo;The Eater Of Worlds&rdquo; is back and that should set up for a very good match. Can Bray summon up enough power from his fireflies to win this match? I think that he will. A few months ago, I stated that Braun would eventually lose the title to the Field and I am sticking with that prediction. Braun won the first match between these two and a win by Wyatt would set up the rubber match between the pair next month at Summer Slam. That is where the Fiend will make an appearance and win back his title. <strong>Prediction: Bray Wyatt +105</strong></p><p><strong><br />WWE Championship Match - Drew McIntyre (-2000) vs Drew Ziggler</strong></p><p>Way back when Vince McMahon stood in the middle of the ring and announced that Drew McIntyre was the future of this company and he would go on to be one of the greatest champions ever. It didn&rsquo;t pan out that way and Drew was eventually fired. McIntyre then bulked up and came back, which was aided by Ziggler. Now Dolph feels that Drew owes him one and he will use the opportunity to take down the WWE Champion. It will not be easy as Drew has turned into one of the most dominant wrestlers on the roster. Drew has taken on all comers and has turned away all of them. One caveat that is unknown for this match is the stipulation, which Drew allowed Dolph to pick. Ziggler decided that it will be a game-day decision, so we will all find out together what the stipulation of this match will be. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it will be, Dolph Ziggler is not winning this match. Drew McIntrye is just too good and powerful for Ziggler to handle, plus WWE might be setting up a Randy Orton vs Drew McIntyre match for the title summer Slam. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be something? This should be a good match but in the end, it will still be Drew that comes out on top. <strong>Prediction: Drew McIntyre -2000 </strong></p>
