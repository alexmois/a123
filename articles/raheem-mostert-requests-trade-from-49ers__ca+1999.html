                        <p>The NFL is expected to start training camps in about three weeks as teams attempt to prepare for the regular season, which is scheduled to kick off on Thursday, September 10 when the Texans travel to Arrowhead Stadium to face the defending champion Chiefs. We&rsquo;ve seen quite a few players change teams via trade and free agency, which is par for the course. In addition, we saw Patrick Mahomes sign his massive ten-year extension earlier this week that has the potential to be worth $503 million. Jadeveon Clowney remains on the free agent market after expecting that he could command more than $20 million a year.</p><p>Now, there appears to be a potential seismic shift in the backfield of the team that the Chiefs beat in the Super Bowl. It was reported on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29430509/rb-raheem-mostert-requests-trade-49ers-agent-says">Raheem Mostert</a>, the running back who took over the starting job in the second half of the season and was effective in the playoffs, has requested a trade. According to Mostert&rsquo;s agent, <a href="https://twitter.com/TesslerSports/status/1280971446769070081">Brett Tessler</a>, on Twitter, the negotiations with the 49ers haven&rsquo;t been productive. He said:</p><p><em>&ldquo;After months of unproductive talks with the 49ers about fairly adjusting Raheem Mostert's contract (which paid him for special teams) we have requested a trade. Disappointing that it would come to this for a guy who led all NFL RBs in YPC & helped lead them to the Super Bowl.&rdquo;</em></p><p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1280980783696674820">Ian Rapoport</a>, Tessler and Mostert simply want to be the highest-paid running back on whatever team he ends up playing for in 2020 and beyond. Tevin Coleman is currently holds that honor as he is in line to make $4.55 million this season. <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/raheem-mostert-17277/">Mostert&rsquo;s base salary</a> on the three-year, $8.7 million deal he signed in March 2019 is $2.575 million for this season. That puts him 23rd among running backs and 19th among 49ers players this season in cap hit numbers, which is $3,158,333. By comparison, kicker Robbie Gould makes $5.1 million a year while fullback Kyle Juszczyk has a $6.7 million cap hit in 2020.</p><p>Mostert became a force in the second half of the season on the ground as Matt Breida struggled with injuries and Tevin Coleman continued to have problems with staying on the field. He finished the regular season with 137 carries for 772 yards and eight scores while adding 14 receptions for 180 yards plus two more touchdowns. Mostert ran for a season-high 146 yards and a score against the Ravens in week 12 on the road. In the playoffs, he turned things up even further as he ran the ball <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MostRa00/gamelog/2019/">53 times for 336 yards</a> (a 6.34 ypc average) and five scores in three games. That included a massive 220-yard, four touchdown game against the Packers in the NFC Championship Game.</p><p>Mostert led the team in rushing in the regular season and in rushing scores. Breida (who was dealt to Miami earlier in the offseason) ran the ball 123 times for 623 yards plus a score while Coleman had 137 carries for 544 yards plus six touchdowns. With Breida gone and Mostert&rsquo;s status up in the air, the 49ers would have to rely on Coleman along with <a href="https://aws.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McKiJe00.htm">Jerick McKinnon</a>, who hasn&rsquo;t had a carry since the 2017 season and has collected on the first two years of his four-year, $30 million deal he signed in March 2018 without getting on the field. Jeff Wilson, who had 27 carries for 105 yards and four scores, is also in the mix.</p><p>Mostert still has two years on his deal but with the discord between him and the team, there is plenty that needs to be figured out if the 49ers hope to have him be a productive member of things next season. As for the trade market, it could be a challenge to find a team willing to give up any major value for a running back given how the value of the position has tapered off in recent years. Breida only fetched a fifth-round selection on Day 3 of the draft and with Mostert already 28, it could be tough to convince a team to offer up what San Francisco might expect to get in return for him. We&rsquo;ll have to see how things transpire for either side and see how things unfold.</p>
