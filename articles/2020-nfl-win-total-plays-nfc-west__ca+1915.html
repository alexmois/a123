                        <p>The 2020 NFL season is still expected to start on time, which would mean that the opening Thursday night game would be played on September 10th. The Houston Texans will visit Arrowhead Stadium to take on the Kansas City Chiefs in that game.</p><p>The full NFL Schedule was released a couple of months ago and so I have been going over the Win Totals for each team, by division. Today I will tackle the NFC West and below you can find the other win total previews I have done so far.</p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-totals-nfc-east__ca+1906.html">NFC East</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-north__ca+1907.html">NFC North</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-nfc-south__ca+1908.html">NFC South</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-east__ca+1917.html">AFC East</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-north__ca+1918.html">AFC North</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-south__ca+1919.html">AFC South</a></p><p><a href="2020-nfl-win-total-plays-afc-west__ca+1920.html">AFC West</a><br /><br /><br /></p><p>All Win Totals & Odds Are Courtesy Of <a href="https://www.betonline.ag/sportsbook/futures-and-props/nfl-team-wins">Betonline.ag</a></p><p><br /><strong><br />Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 7.5 (-120), Under 7.5 (-110)</strong></p><p>The Arizona Cardinals had another rough season last year as they went just 5-10-1 but this is a team that is definitely on the rise. Arizona had a solid draft and they got a major upgrade at wide receiver when they traded for DeAndre Hopkins. He will pair nicely with Larry Fitzgerald. Kyler Murray had a solid rookie season and he will be even better in year two. This will be an exciting offense to watch. The defense has a lot of ground to make up after having such a bad season last year but they added LB Isaiah Simmons in the draft, plus a couple of free-agent pickups that will help improve this unit greatly. Now the question is, can they win eight games? Well, let&rsquo;s look at the schedule. On the home slate, the Cards have games against Washington, Detroit, Seattle, Miami, Buffalo, LA Rams, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The latter two along with the Seattle game should be tough and I will expect them to go at least 5-3 in at home. On the road, they have to face San Francisco, Carolina, the Jets, Dallas, Seattle, New England, the Giants, and the Rams. Carolina and the Jets should amount to wins, and I feel they can squeeze another one out of the rest of the road slate. Probably against the Giants. That puts the Cards at 8-8 on the year and gives us an Over here. <strong>Prediction: Arizona Over 7.5 (-120)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Los Angeles Rams</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 8.5 (-105), Under 8.5 (-125)</strong></p><p>The Los Angeles Rams went 9-7 last year but it was only good for 3rd place in the NFC West. It seems that they must have suffered the Super Bowl hangover after making it to the big game the year before. The Rams will now try and regroup but they are in perhaps the toughest division in all of football. The Rams were a very solid offensive team and that was thanks mostly to their passing game, led by Jared Goff, who threw for 4638 yards and 22 TDs. The one bad thing is that Goff has now thrown 28 INTs in his last two seasons. He will have to correct that moving forward. The running game will not be the same with Todd Gurley now in Atlanta, but the did take Cam Akers with their first pick of the draft. Still, it is hard to see the ground attack improving on last year&rsquo;s 26th ranking. The defense was very average for the Rams last year and they are hoping to be a much better group this season. They did take a pretty big hit to their defense with the loss of LB Dante Fowler, who is now in Atlanta. The Rams may look to third-round pick LB Terrell Lewis, to fill the void, while the secondary will get help with the addition of Terrell Burgess. At home, the Rams will face Dallas, the Giants, Chicago, Seattle, San Fran, the Jets, New England, and Arizona. The Giants and Jets appear to be the only slam dunks in that schedule, still, they should go 5-3 at home. On the road, they face Philadelphia, Buffalo, Washington, San Francisco, Miami, Tampa Bay, Arizona, Seattle. Washington & Miami are the only two easy games on that slate. LA should go 3-5 on the road. This is an average team overall and that is the kind of record they will post. <strong>Prediction: Los Angeles Under 8.5 (-125).</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 10.5 (-125), Under 10.5 (-105)</strong></p><p>The San Francisco 49ers went 13-3 last year and they made it all the way to the Superbowl, before falling to the Chiefs by a 31-20 score. The Niners had a 20-10 lead in the 4th quarter before it all came crashing down. They will look to make amends for that this year. San Francisco had a very solid draft considering they had just five picks. They also have a major portion of their team returning from a year ago. They lost WR Emmanuel Sanders to the saints but brought in Brandon Aiyuk in the draft. The defense, which was very good last year, could be even better with the addition of first-round pick Javon Kinlaw. This is a team that may have gotten better than last year&rsquo;s team and they are on a mission, so how can you not expect them to win at least 11 games this year? Yes, the NFC West is much improved overall but still, the Niners are heavily favored to win it. They have home games against Arizona, Philadelphia, Miami, the Rams, Green Bay, Buffalo, Washington, Seattle. There are some toughies in there but the Niners should go at least 7-1 at home this year. Their road slate consists of games at the Jets, Giants, Patriots, Seahawks, Saints, Rams, Cowboys, and Cardinals. The final six road games are tough but San Fran should go at least 4-4 away from home this year and that puts them at 11 wins. <strong>Prediction: San Francisco Over 10.5 (-125)</strong></p><p><strong><br /><br />Seattle Seahawks</strong></p><p><strong>Win Total - Over 9 (-140), Under 9 (+110)</strong></p><p>The Seattle Seahawks had a solid 11-5 season a year ago but they still finished two games out of first in the NFC West. The Seahawks did beat the Eagles in the Wildcard round by a score of 17-9 before losing to the Packers in the divisional round by a score of 28-23. They will now look to regroup and they have a solid team to do it with but matching last year&rsquo;s win total may be tough as the NFC West will be tough this year. The offense is led by Russell Wilson, who had the best season of his career. He threw for 4110 yards with 31 TDs and just five INTs while rushing for 342 yards and three TDs. The wide receiver corps remains intact with Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf both returning, plus they have added Phillip Dorsett and Seattle could be making a play for FA WR Antonio Brown. Chris Carson burst on to the scene with 1151 yards rushing and nine TDs last year and he completes what will again be a very solid offensive team. Despite going 11-5 on the year the Seahawks still had all sorts of problems on the defensive side of the ball. They hope to have addressed some of those issues after taking two defensive players in their first two picks in the draft. They have added LB Bruce Irvin and DB Quinton Dunbar, so the defense should be improved overall. Seattle&rsquo;s home games consist of New England, Dallas, Minnesota, San Francisco, Arizona, The Giants & Jets, and the Rams. I see at least a 6-2 record in those games but remember that teams may not have all their fans in the stands this year and that will take away part of the 12th man at CenturyLink Field. On the road, Seattle has games at Atlanta, Miami, Arizona, Buffalo, The Rams, Philadelphia, Washington, and san Francisco. I can see Seattle going at least 4-4 in those games. With an improved defense they should bag at least 10 wins this year but even if they don&rsquo;t they will not have less than nine wins and that would give us a push at worst. <strong>Prediction: Seattle Over 9 (-145)</strong></p>
