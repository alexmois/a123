                        <p>NFL Week 9 Betting Recap</p><p>The season is really moving fast. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each game from Week 9 and look at the betting implications that occurred and may also affect the line in Week 10 and beyond.</p><p>(closing lines) (Home team in caps)</p><p><strong>NFL </strong></p><p><strong>Thursday, Nov. 3</strong></p><p>Philadelphia (-13.5) over HOUSTON 29-17/Over 45</p><p>The Eagles did not cover the big number on the road and were never covering. They got close in the end, but Houston scored on their first drive with Davis Mills hitting rookie TE Teagan Quitoriano for a 2-yard TD and then WR Chris Moore for 13 yards. The second half was all about the Eagles who allowed a shocking 168 yards on the ground to the Texans. Rookie Dameon Pierce added 139 yards on 27 carries. Jalen Hurts threw for an efficient 243 yards and two TDs, but was held to just 93 yards rushing. Even though the Eagles didn&rsquo;t cover, they improved to 8-0 for the first time ever. Mills continues to struggle for Houston with 154 yards passing and two picks. The Texans, at 1-6-1, is looking at the No. 1 pick next season.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Sunday, Nov. 6</p><p>NY JETS (+10.5) over Buffalo 20-17/Under 46</p><p>The Jets are for real! At 6-3, their defense held down an explosive offense that is now under a microscope now that Josh Allen (elbow) is having injury issues. Allen struggled threw two bad picks and fumbled late in the game when hit by DE Bryce Huff and appeared to get hurt on the play. Check the status on Allen&rsquo;s UCL injury as he is listed as questionable for their game against the Vikings on Sunday. If he can&rsquo;t go, that means it&rsquo;s Case Keenum time. They can also use LB Matt Milano (oblique), who missed the Jets game. The Jets ran for 174 yards against the Bills&rsquo; run defense, which was shredded the weak before by Green Bay in the second half. Michael Carter rushed for 76 yards and a TD, while new RB James Robinson, from Jacksonville, added 48 yards. The Jets go into the bye at 6-3 and with an offense that is finding a way to win and a defense that has the swagger of their outstanding rookie CB Sauce Gardner.</p><p>Minnesota (-3) over WASHINGTON 20-17/Under 43.5</p><p>This game was a push or maybe a Washington win in some books. If you bet Washington, you had the right side. The Commanders had a 17-7 lead in the fourth quarter and allowed the Vikes to score 13 unanswered points to fall by three. Taylor Heinicke threw a late pick to allow the Vikes to kick the game-winning FG. Kirk Cousins completed just 22 for 40 for 265 yards with two TDs and a pick in his first game in Washington since leaving five the Skins five years ago to join Minnesota. Washington&rsquo;s defense stopped the run (56 yards), but their lack of a passing game (126 yards) hampered their offense. Minnesota improved to 7-1 and will face Buffalo on Sunday.</p><p>DETROIT (+4) over Green Bay 15-9/Under 49.5</p><p>The Packers have now lost five straight for the first time in 14 years. Aaron Rodgers threw three picks, including two inside the 10. Detroit led 8-0 at the half and that was after driving to the 10-yard line on their opening possession and turning it over on downs. Green Bay lost LB Rashan Gary (ACL) for the season. And RB Aaron Jones (ankle) was injured against the Lions. They also lost rookie WR Romeo Doubs (ankle) for 4-6 weeks. Detroit broke a five-game losing streak despite Jared Goff throwing for just 137 yards. The key was winning the turnover battle (+2).</p><p>LA Chargers (-3) over ATLANTA 20-17/Under 49.5</p><p>Another push game for bettors. If you bet Atlanta, you have to be frustrated. The Falcons had a 10-0 lead in the first quarter and a 17-14 lead late in the third quarter. But they had two key fumbles lost including a bizarre play late in the game when Austin Ekeler fumbled the ball at the Atlanta 20-yard line and Ta&rsquo;Quon Graham scooped up the ball and ran 21 yards before fumbling at the Atlanta 43. Three plays later, backup kicker Cameron Dicker nailed a 37-yard field goal to give the Chargers the win. Justin Herbert completed 30 of 43 for 245 yards with 1 TD and 1 INT. Joshua Palmer caught eight passes for 106 yards for the Chargers. Marcus Mariota completed just 12 of 23 for 129 yards and ran for 24. WR Kennan Allen (hamstring) continues to be questionable each week and miss games for the Chargers. Atlanta could really use CB A.J. Terrell (hamstring), who is ? for their Thursday game against the Panthers.</p><p>CHICAGO (+4.5) over Miami 32-35/Over 45.5</p><p>This was a battle of young up-and-coming quarterbacks with Tau Tagovailoa against Justin Fields. Tagovailoa got the win with 302 yards passing and three TDs. Fields threw for just 123 yards, but had three TDs passing and 178 yards rushing with a TD. That broke Michael Vick&rsquo;s record for most rushing yards by a QB in one game. The Bears fell to 3-6, but they became just the second team to rush for 225+ years in four straight games. Jeff Wilson caught a TD pass for the Dolphins in his first game coming over from San Francisco. Miami still needs to run the ball better as they scored 35 points through the first 2 &frac12; quarters, but were held scoreless in the final quarter-and-a-half. They ran for just 77 yards on 23 carries.</p><p>JACKSONVILLE (+2.5) over LAS VEGAS 27-20/Under 48.5</p><p>The Raiders bizarre season continues as they fell to 2-6 and 0-5 on the road this season. They were up 20-10 at the half and were held scoreless in the second half. They struggled to contain Travis Etienne Jr, who rushed for 109 yards and two TDs for the Jags. The good news for the Raiders is that Derek Carr finally found Davante Adams again, who caught 10 passes for 146 yards and two TDs. Good news for Jacksonville is that Trevor Lawrence did not throw a pick and passed for 235 yards and a TD. Oakland TE Darren Waller (hamstring) has missed three straight games and is still day-to-day.</p><p>NEW ENGLAND (-4.5) over Indianapolis/Under 40.5</p><p>The pats are back to Mac Jones at QB, but it was their defense that won the game against Frank Reich&rsquo;s Colts. This was Reich&rsquo;s last game as head coach as he would be fired the next day. Matthew Judon and Josh Uche had three sacks apiece. The Colts generated just eight first downs against a tough New England defense. Young QB Sam Ehlinger with just 103 yards passing, one pick and 39 yards rushing The Pats weren&rsquo;t much better on offense, producing just 11 first downs and 70 rushing yards. Mac Jones completed 20 of 30 for just 147 yards passing and a TD. RB Damien Harris (illness) should return after the Pats&rsquo; bye week. The Colts could use another bye and will now be coached by former C Jeff Saturday against the Raiders this week.</p><p>CINCINNATI (-12.5) over Carolina 42-21/Over 44.5</p><p>There was nothing fancy about this blowout. It was a Joe Mixon return to Pro Bowl form. The RB was sensational with 153 yards rushing and four TDs. He also had four catches for 58 yards and a score. This game was over at halftime as the Bengal (5-4) led 35-0. The Panthers went back to Baker Mayfield at QB, who threw for two TDs late in the game. Starter P.J. Walker was pulled after he went 3 for 10 for 9 yards and two picks in the first half. Carolina had just one first down in the first half. Sam Darnold (ankle) could also be back this week against Atlanta on Thursday.</p><p>Seattle (+2.5) over ARIZONA 31-21/Over 49.5</p><p>What a story out West! It wasn&rsquo;t the prettiest win for Geno Smith and the Seahawks. Bu they got the job done in the fourth quarter. Smith had a rare pick-6, but came back from that to lead Seattle to a 10-point win and a 6-3 record. Rookie RB Kenneth Walker III rushed for 109 yards and two fourth-quarter TDs. Smith completed 26 of 34 for 275 yards and a short TD to DK Metcalf. Arizona scored just two offensive TDs. Kyler Murray threw for 175 yards and two TDs, while rushing for 60 yards on eight attempts. But they scored a late TD with 3:32 left to cut the lead to three. However, Seattle went right back down the field and Walker scored with 2:14 left to clinch the win.</p><p>TAMPA BAY (-3) over LA Rams 16-13/Under 42.5</p><p>Before this season, you would expect a shootout, but both offenses are struggling mainly due to inefficient offensive lines. Yet, the Rams had a 13-6 lead going into the fourth quarter and couldn&rsquo;t hold onto the lead. Tom Brady drove the Bucs (4-5) downfield 60 yards in 35 seconds with no timeouts. He found rookie TE Cade Otton for a 1-yard TD pass with nine seconds left to get the win. Brady threw for 280 yards, while the Bucs held Matthew Stafford to just 165 yards and a TD. Both teams struggle to run the football. The Rams produced just 9 first downs and ran for 68 yards on 24 carries.</p><p>TENNESSEE (+13.5) over Kansas City 17-20/Under 45.5</p><p>The Titans had a solid defensive gameplan against the Chiefs, though Patrick Mahomes still managed to throw for 422 yards and ran for a career-high 63 yards with a TD. But he also threw a pick in 68 attempts. Rookie QB Malik Willis ran for 40 yards, but completed just 5 of 16 for 80 yards. Derrick Henry ran for just 17 attempts for 115 yards and two TDs. They had a 17-9 lead but Mahomes led the Chiefs down the field on a 13-play, 93 yards drive to tie the score at 17 with 2:56 left in regulation. Kansas City won it in overtime on a 28-yard field goal from Harrison Butker. Titans&rsquo; QB Ryan Tannehill (ankle) is questionable for Game 10.</p><p><strong>Monday, November 7, 2022</strong></p><p>Baltimore (-1.5) over NEW ORLEANS 27-13</p><p>The Ravens jumped out to a 14-0 lead and didn&rsquo;t relinquish the lead in a fairly easy win. Baltimore won despite not having TE Mark Andrews (shoulder/neck), RB Gus Edwards (hamstring) and WR Rashod Bateman (foot). Edwards should return after the bye week. Andrews might return, though rookie Isaiah Likely (1 catch for 24 yds, 1 TD) is capable. Lamar Jackson threw for 133 yards (12 of 22) and ran for 82 yards. It was back to the running game for the Ravens as Kenyon Drake led with 93 yards and two TDs. New LB Roquan Smith, acquired in a trade with Chicago last week, helped Baltimore hold the Saints to 243 total yards and just 48 rushing yards. Justin Houston led the defense with 2.5 sacks and a pick. The Saints could use some receiving help from WR Jarvis Landry (ankle), who has missed five straight games. WR Michael Thomas (dislocated toe) was placed on the IR.</p>
