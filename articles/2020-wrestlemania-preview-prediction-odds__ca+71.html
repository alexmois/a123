                        <p>The show of shows is finally here&hellip; sort of. Wrestlemania is the biggest event of the year on the world of wrestling and while the show will go on, it will take place at the WWE Performance Center and with no fans. Wrestlemania will also take place over two nights as it is just too big for one night. I will note that Wrestlemania 36 was taped two weeks ago and each match has two endings so to keep the outcomes from each match leaking to the internet. I like that idea.</p><p>We all need a little distraction and these two nights will off us that, so sit back and enjoy the shows.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Otis (-170) vs Dolph Ziggler (+130)</p><p>This one is very personal, especially for Otis, who is apart of Heavy Machinery. His partner is Tucker. Back on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, Otis had a date set up with Mandy Rose but he received a text saying she would be late. He arrived at the date only to find out that Zigger had swooped in to take his place. All the time mandy thought that Otis had stood her up until this Friday night at the end of the Ziggler/ Tucker match. After Ziggler was disqualified during the match a mysterious hooded figure showed a video of both Sonya Deville and Dolph Ziggler setting up Otis to miss his date. Turns out that Sonya did it because she wants Mandy, and yes, Sonya is a Lesbian in real life. She would get what she wanted and Ziggler would get what he want. Since February 14th, Ziggler has tormented Otis with his relationship with Mandy. Will the Beast win over Beauty? Who is the hooded figure? Will Otis squash Ziggler like a bug? Otis is on a rampage and after the video came out you can bet that he will now go full boar and I don&rsquo;t see Ziggler holding up to the challenge. It will be a happy ending for Otis in this one. Prediction: Otis (-170)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Elias (-120) vs King Corbin (-120)</p><p>This one should be interesting. After his long war with Roman Reigns, Baron Corbin has set his sights on Elias. During a recent episode of Smackdown, it was announced that Rob Gronkowski would host the two-night event. Gronk was celebrating in the ring with his friend Mojo Rawley when king Corbin came out to interrupt the festivities. Elias then came pout to mock the King with a song that he has been working on. Corbin then got in the face of Rawley and Gronk, who was laughing at him. Elias then got in on the little beatdown of Corbin and Gronk announced that the match between the two is set for Wrestlemania. The following week on Smackdown, Corbin attacked Elias, who had just finished up a song and then dropped him from a balcony at the Performance Center. Elias now has revenge on his mind and will stop at nothing to get it, while at the same time knocking down the King a peg or two. I feel that Elias will be able to get his revenge with his biggest hit, which is Drift Away. Prediction Elias (-120)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Aleister Black (-700) vs Bobby Lashley (+400)</p><p>We haven&rsquo;t seen a ton of Bobby Lashley of late after his battles with Rusev where he stole the Bulgarian Brute&rsquo;s wife and married her. Don&rsquo;t worry, they didn&rsquo;t marry in real life and Rusev and Lana are still very happy. LOL. Aleister Black was always looking for someone to challenge him to a fight when he first came up to the main roster and now he is looking to take the fight to the lockerroom. Black has been on a roll lately and this will be a great test for him to see if he is real or just a flash in the pan. Bobby Lashley has been in the WWE for many years and after his feud with Rusev, he is now looking to get back into the title picture. A win over the red-hot Black would be a step in the right direction for him. This is a match between two of the better wrestlers on the roster, who are both looking to make a statement and that should mean we will see an all-out war. It is hard to ignore the roll that Black has been on and I feel he is the rising star that will pick up the biggest win of his career. It&rsquo;s a steep price and probably not worth playing but still, Black will win this one. Prediction: Aleister Black (-700)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>John Cena (+300) vs The Fiend (-500): Firefly Fun House Match</p><p>It&rsquo;s Wrestlemania and that means we get to see (or not see) John Cena. He has been on the Undertakers schedule of late and that is to really show up just once a year. A few weeks ago on Smackdown, Cena came out and announced that he would not be participating in this year&rsquo;s Wrestlemania. He said that it was time for the younger talent on the roster to be showcased. It was a nice speech and as he was leaving the ring, out comes The Fiend, who pointed at the Wrestlemania sign. With the tip of his cap, Cena accepted and here were are in what Bray call&rsquo;s a Firefly Fun House match. The funny thing is that no one even knows what kind of match it will be. What is a Firefly Fun House Match? I guess we will all find out together. The Fiend will not be in a good mood for this match after losing his Universal Title against Goldberg at Super Showdown and he is looking to get back on track here. John Cena has been in some huge matches at Wrestlemania and this one will be big as well. Can Big-Match John return to the squared circle and pick up a win over the evil Fiend. I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;m not sure why the WWE took the belt off of Bray and gave it to Goldberg. He had been a dominant force in the WWE and I see him picking up a huge win over the 16-time WWE Champion in this one. Prediction: The Fiend (-500)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>AJ Styles (+250) vs The Undertaker (-400) (Boneyard Match)</p><p>This should be a good match. Most of Undertaker&rsquo;s matches are at Wrestlemania and he is one of the winningest wrestlers at the event. Back at super Showdown, AJ Styles was competing in the Tuwaiq Mountain Trophy Gauntlet Match and after his OC Brethren took out Rey Mysterio before he came out, Undertaker then took his place. He ended up winning the Gauntlet match with a win over Styles. Then at Elimination Chamber, it was Styles vs Aleister Black in a No Disqualification Match and Taker came out again to pave the way for Black to get the win. The pair were supposed to have a contract signing on a recent episode of Raw but Styles never came out to the ring. Instead, he signed the contract in the back and sent his cronies out to deliver it to the Undertaker. Bad move as he destroyed the OC. AJ made the stipulation that this will be a Boneyard Match and he also promised to take the Deadman&rsquo;s soul in this match. Back at Wrestlemania 33, it looked as if the Undertaker&rsquo;s career was over, but Styles has stated that it is Taker&rsquo;s wife, Michelle McCool, that keeps him coming back for more. That pissed off the Deadman even more. Can AJ beat Undertaker in one of the Deadman&rsquo;s own matches? Can Undertaker pick up another huge win on the grandest stage of all? Will the OC get involved? Who will steal whose soul? I am going to back AJ in this one. He is the Phenomenal one and does have the backup of his cronies for this one. The Taker will just not be able to keep up in this one. Prediction: Aj Styles +250</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Kevin Owens (-220) vs. Seth Rollins (+150)</p><p>A return to the Performance Center is huge for both of these wrestlers. Kevin Owens defied all the odds to make a name for himself here in the WWE and it started with him dominating NXT. Owens then made the move up to the main roster and beat John Cena on his first night at Raw. Seth Rollins also got his start in NXT at the Performance Center and was actually crowned as the very first NXT champ. This match has been brewing for months after Rollins turned heel and Owens stated that he will not fall lock-step in line with Seth, who is determined to run the show. Rollins has the AOP and Murphy as his henchmen and they have been running roughshod through the WWE for the last few months and Owens will be looking to stop their momentum. KO is not one to back down from a fight, so when Rollins laid down the challenge, he had no hesitation in accepting and the decision was made even easier with the match taking place at the Performance Center. Owens knows he will be in for a hell of a fight and he also knows that he will be outnumbered as well. Will anyone else from the back come out to help keep the AOP and Murphy at bay? Can KO stop the Momentum of Rollins? Can Seth continue to show that he is the dominant force on Raw? I will go with the latter. Seth has too many weapons in his arsenal, especial;y with the AOP and Murphy looking out for him. I feel they will play a role in this one and help Seth to the huge win. Prediction: Seth Rollins +150</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Edge (-500) vs. Randy Orton (+300) (Last Man Standing Match)</p><p>This will be a Last Man Standing Match and that means the loser of the match is the one who can not make a ten count. These are always brutal matches and fun ones as well. How great was it to see Edge make his return at the Royal Rumble? After having to retire nine years ago due to a neck injury, Edge is back in the WWE. It was one of the most inspirational returns in the history of the WWE. Edge didn&rsquo;t win the Rumble but he did eliminate a few participants, including Randy Orton. The Next on raw, it looked as if Orton was going to team back up with the Rated &ldquo;R&rdquo; Superstar, but instead, he hit him with an RKO and then bashed Edges head with a couple of chair shots. Orton stated that he did it out of love. Edge needs to be a father to his two girls and he can&rsquo;t do that if he gets permanently damaged in the ring. A couple of weeks late, Edge&rsquo;s wife, Beth Phoenix, came out to give an update on her husband and Orton proceeded to hit her with an RKO as well. This will be a very personal match as edge displayed the following week when he called out Orton and went off on the Viper, hitting him with an RKO of his own. These two were a dominant tag team back in the day and now they are going to tear each other apart. Edge has the Edge in this one and the momentum, plus he has been itching to get back for a real match. It all adds up to the Rated &ldquo;R&rdquo; Superstar picking up his first win in the WWE in nine years as he is the Last Man Standing. Prediction: Edge (-500)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>WWE Women's Tag Team Champions The Kabuki Warriors vs. Alexa Bliss & Nikki Cross (No Odds Listed)</p><p>Back in 2019 at Hell In A Cell, the Kabuki Warriors took the WWE Women&rsquo;s Tag Titles from Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross and now the pair has a chance to win their belts back. Asuka hit Nikki in the face with the green mist and that is how they won the match. It is time for revenge for Bliss and Cross. Bliss then missed some action for a couple of months before returning in November to reunite with her best friend. Back on the March 13th episode of Smackdown, Bliss and Cross were facing Sasha Banks and Bayley when the Kabuki Warriors provided a distraction to help Banks and Bayley win the match. The two teams have played mind games with each other over the next couple of weeks before Bliss picked up a huge win over Asuka in a recent episode of Smackdown. That gives Bliss and Cross some momentum and I feel they will use it to take back their Women&rsquo;s Title belts. The Kabuki warriors have not defended their belts all that much and I feel that it is time for them to lose them. Prediction: Alexa Bliss & Nikki Cross</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Raw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits vs. Austin Theory & Angel Garza (No Odds Listed)</p><p>This match was originally supposed to be the Street Profits vs Andrade and Angel Garza, but Andrade is dealing with a broken rib and has been ruled out for this match. Selina Vega has reached into her deep pool of prospects and pulled out Austin Theory, who is one of the rising stars of NXT. Garza is a former NXT Cruiserweight Champion and has started to make a name for himself up here on the Main Roster under the tutelage of Selina Vega. You can bet she will be a factor in this match. The Street profits shocked the world by taking out Rollins and Murphy on an episode of Raw a little over a month ago and then they successfully defended their titles against the pair at Elimination Chamber. Montez Ford & Angelo Dawkins have all the momentum and they are the better team that has been together much longer than Garza and Theory. The Street Profits will remain champs after this one but it still should be a high-flying fun match. Prediction: The Street Profits</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Miz & John Morrison (+100) vs. The Usos (+120) vs. The New Day (300) (Triple Threat Ladder Match)</p><p>This match should be a fun one as most ladder matches are and especially with these three teams in the match. John Morrison recently returned to the WWE after eight years away and quickly got back together with The Miz. In their first title match, they won the belts from the New Day. Their first title defense was at Elimination Chamber and the successfully defended the titles by beating five other teams in the match. A couple of weeks ago, the New Day and The Usos were in a number one contender&rsquo;s match and Miz and Morrison got involved so there was no winner declared. Miz and Morrison thought they had taken out both teams and would be taking Wrestlemania off. The joke was on them as management put them in a triple threat ladder match for the belts. These matches are all high flying fun matches. The New Day and The Usos have a million titles between them but I do not feel that Miz and Morrison are going to be losing the belts on this night. They have the momentum and they are ruthless enough to take advantage of all the rules in a ladder match. Prediction: Miz & Morrison (+100)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Intercontinental Champion Sami Zayn (-200) vs. Daniel Bryan (+150)</p><p>Is it time for Daniel Bryan to put some gold back around his waist? We shall see. Back at Elimination Chamber, Sami Zayn, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Cesaro met Braun Stroman for the Intercontinental Title and it was Zayn who got the pin over the monster of men. He was barely touched in the match and haven&rsquo;t been touched for the last few months as each time he is at ringside for a match, and someone comes after him, he runs away like a little girl. There will be no running away in this one as he is taking on Daniel Bryan in a one-on-one match. Sami will have to get his hands dirty but he will have the advantage with Nakamura and Cesaro at ringside. Zayn did try and recruit DB to be apart of his team but he turned them down and then asked Drew Gulac to help train him. Gulac had been saying that he knows all of Daniel&rsquo;s weaknesses and can help him. He obliged and DB has been on a roll ever since. Still, I have to go with Sami in this one. He is a dirty player and so are his cohorts on the outside. Look for Zayn to find a way to retain his belt. Prediction Sami Zayn -200</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>NXT Women&rsquo;s Champion Rhea Ripley (-180) vs. Charlotte Flair (+140)</p><p>This is one that I am so excited to see. Back in January, Charlotte Flair won the Royal Rumble and by winning that match, she is able to choose any title to go after. Normally, the winner of the Rumble for both the men or women will choose to go after one of the titles from Raw or Smackdown. Charlotte Flair threw a monkey wrench in those plans by selecting the NXT Women&rsquo;s champion, Rhea Ripley. A few months ago, it was Rhea Ripley that ended the dominance of Shayna Basler to take the Women&rsquo;s NXT Title and she has held it ever since. Baszler had held the title for 416 days. Ripley has been building up a strong resume of late, leading NXT to a win over Raw and Smackdown in the Survivor Series PPV. She also pinned Flair in a triple threat match and she also guided her squad to victory in the first-ever Women&rsquo;s WarGames Match. The nightmare has been a nightmare for all three brands over the last few months, but this could be her biggest test year. Charlotte Flair did hold the NXT Women&rsquo;s title for 258 days and has since gone on to being the most decorated woman in WWE history as she is a 10-time woman&rsquo;s champ. The pair have been trading attacks on one another of late and that should set up for a good confrontation in this one. Charlotte is headed back to where it all started for her in this one but I do not see her taking the title. Ripley has been named the nightmare for a reason and she will be Flair&rsquo;s nightmare in this one as her trip back to the Performance Center will not go as she had hoped it would. Prediction: Rhea Ripley</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>SmackDown Women&rsquo;s Champion Bayley (+175) vs. Sasha Banks (+175) vs. Lacey Evans (+270) vs. Tamina (+550) vs. Naomi (+550) (WrestleMania Fatal 5-Way Elimination Match)</p><p>This one should be interesting. Bayley has been champ for 316 days now but this could be her toughest test year as she will be facing Lacey Evans, Tamina, Naomi and her best friend, Sasha Banks. Having Banks in the match is the real wildcard as she and Bayley have had each other's backs over the last several months and now they must at some point face each other. That will make for a very interesting storyline. Tamina is the powerhouse of this match and she just won a triple threat match between her Evans and Naomi on Friday night. Then she took out both Banks and Bayley. That makes it too obvious that she will not be the one to win the match. Naomi is one of the most athletic women in the WWE locker room but it is hard to see here winning this one. I feel that it will come down to Bayley, Banks, and Evans. This could be a good chance for Bayley and banks to have a falling out which will open the door for Evans to steal the title. She is an up-and-coming superstar and has all the tools to be a fine champion. That Woman&rsquo;s Right is a heck of a punch and she will knock one of the other four women out to win the belt from the longest reigning Smackdown Women&rsquo;s titleholder. Prediction: Lacey Evans +270</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Raw Women&rsquo;s Champion Becky Lynch (+140) vs. Shayna Baszler (-180)</p><p>This is another match that I am looking forward to seeing. I don&rsquo;t like many heels in the WWE but I do Like Shayna Baszler. She has the tenacity and is very intense and will give Becky Lynch a great fight. Basler lost her title a few months back to Rhea Ripley and that allowed her to make her way to the main roster. She made her presence known on an episode of Raw in early January by taking Becky Lynch from behind and then taking a chunk out of her neck with her teeth. That showed the kind of mean streak that the Queen of Spades has. Becky then was rooting for Baszler to win the Elimination Chamber match which would pit the two against each other here at Mania. Shayna obliged by easily winning the Elimination Chamber match as she knocked all five women out in quick fashion. Beck has been Champ since last year&rsquo;s Wrestlemania when she defeated both Rhonda Rousey and Charlotte Flair. Over the past year, she has turned back the likes of Lacey Evans, Natalya, and Asuka in several great matches. This one should be great as well as both wrestlers are in their prime and both have a mean streak as well. Baszler will put on a great show and while I am a huge fan of hers, I feel that Becky will find a way to retain her title. It is too obvious that Baszler will win and when that happens, it doesn&rsquo;t always play out that way. Prediction: Becky Lynch +140</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Universal Champion Goldberg (+155) vs. Braun Stroman (-220)</strong></h3></p><p>Roman Reigns had recovered from cancer just over a year ago, so he does have an underlying condition and that makes him vulnerable to Covid-19. Roman has pulled out of this match because of that and so the WWE entered Braun Stroman. The Monster Among Men now has a shot at the Universal Title. In his last match, he lost the Intercontinental Title in a three-on-one handicap match against Sami Zayn, Cesaro and Shinsuke Nakamura. Braun is the most destructive wrestler on the roster but can he take down the Hall of Famer in Goldberg in this match? Bill Goldberg stunned and also pissed off much of the WWE Universe by taking the Universal Title from The Fiend at Super Showdown. I think that Roman was going to win this match but now that it is Braun Stroman in his place, it will be Goldberg that comes out on top and retains his title. The WWE just doesn&rsquo;t want Stroman to have the title. At least that is the feeling that I get. Spear, Jackhammer, One, Two, Three. Goldberg retains. Prediction: Goldberg +155</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>WWE Champion Brock Lesnar (+220) vs. Drew McIntyre (-350)</p><p>And we have finally made it to the biggest match of Wrestlemania 36. Brock Lesnar vs Drew McIntyre. I am glad that this match is going off with no substitutes. Drew McIntyre is the winner of the 2020 royal Rumble match and the champion he chose to face is Brock Lesnar, who the WWE continues to put the belt on, despite the fans opposing to it. Back at the Rumble, Brock entered as the first overall wrestler and he eliminated the first 15 men that were in the ring with him. Ricochet then cam in and following him was Drew McIntyre. It looked as if Lesnar and McIntyre were about to square off in an epic battle when Ricochet hit Brock with a low blow and then Drew followed it up with a claymore kick, knocking the Beast Incarnate out of the Rumble. McIntyre then went on to win the rumble and thus setting up what should be a classic battle. Brock has been running roughshod over the WWE for years and other than facing Goldberg, this could be his toughest test yet. Drew was dubbed as the Chosen One by Vince Mcmahon many years ago, but he never took the role that the Chairman expected. Drew then was fired before returning a changed man. Since then he has had some classic matches, but still, this is his first shot at one of the major titles in WWE. A few weeks ago, Drew made a statement by coming out when Brock was being touted by Paul Heyman and hit him with three claymore kicks. Brock was reeling but has a chance to get revenge in this one. I don&rsquo;t think he will. This is a huge chance for Drew and after working his ass off to get that chance, he will not blow it. The fans will get what they want in this one. Prediction: Drew McIntyre -350</p>
