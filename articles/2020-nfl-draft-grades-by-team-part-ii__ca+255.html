                        <p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: CB, WR, DL, OL, LB</p><p>First Round - WR Henry Ruggs, Alabama. Grade: B-</p><p>First Round - CB Damon Arnette, Ohio State. Grade: D+</p><p>Third Round - WR/RB Lynn Bowden, Kentucky. Grade: B-</p><p>Third Round - WR Bryan Edwards, South Carolina. Grade: B-</p><p>Third Round - S Tanner Muse, Clemson. Grade: C</p><p>Fourth Round - OG John Simpson, Clemson: Grade: B-</p><p>Fourth Round - CB Amirk Robertson, La. Tech. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: Raiders predictably picked Ruggs at 12 based on their past. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Not a bad pick, but Jeudy was the better receiver. Arnette was a reach with their other first-round pick. He is a versatile player, but taking him in the third was a slight gamble. Bowden was a running quarterback with Kentucky. Has good quickness and build. Love the size that Muse has for a safety but he doesn't really have a position. Simpson was a better pick in the fourth round as they went back-to-back Clemson Tigers. They added three receivers and Edwards is another with good size and speed. But hands? Mike Mayock did another solid job.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: B-</strong></p><p><strong>LA Chargers</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: QB, OT, LB, Edge, TE</p><p>First Round - QB Justin Herbert, Oregon. Grade: C-</p><p>First Round - LB Kenneth Murray, Oklahoma. Grade: B+</p><p>Fourth Round - RB Joshua Kelley, UCLA. Grade: B-</p><p>Fifth Round - WR Joe Reed, West Virginia. Grade: B-</p><p>Sixth Round - S Alohi Gilman, Notre Dame. Grade: C-</p><p>Seventh Round - WR K.J. Hill, Ohio State. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: The key to the entire draft is Herbert. He's not worth the sixth pick at this point, but he could develop into a solid quarterback in a couple of years. It's a gamble. The Chargers traded with New England to get the No. 23 pick and took Murray. Very solid pick there, however, they ended up with no second and third-round picks. They found Joshua Kelley in the fourth round, was their best pick in the draft in terms of value. I also liked Reed in the fifth round, who could be a great special teams guy.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: C</strong></p><p><strong>Los Angeles Rams</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: LB, Edge, RB, WR, OL</p><p>Second Round - RB Cam Akers, Florida State. Grade: A</p><p>Second Round - WR Van Jefferson, Florida. Grade: C-</p><p>Third Round - LB Terrell Lewis, Alabama. Grade: A-</p><p>Third Round - S Terrell Burgess, Utah. Grade: B-</p><p>Fourth Round - TE Brycen Hopkins, Purdue: Grade: B-</p><p>Comments: Rams has no first-rounder thanks to the Jalen Ramsey trade last year, but two second-round picks. Akers was a very strong pick in the second round. He's a playmaker with good size and speed. Might not be Todd Gurley, but they needed a back. He did play on a bad FSU team last season. Van Jefferson was a bit of a reach in the second round. Good route runner and son of former NFLer Shawn Jefferson. Not very explosive. Lewis was an excellent pick here. Good size and athleticism. Injuries are a concern, but good value at the third. Burgess is a versatile safety and solid tackler. Tight end was a need and Hopkins is going to help as a receiver.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: B</strong></p><p><strong>Miami Dolphins</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: QB, OL, RB, S, Edge</p><p>First Round - QB Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama. Grade: B+</p><p>First Round - OT Austin Jackson, USC. Grade: C+</p><p>First Round - CB Noah Igbinoghene, Auburn. Grade: C</p><p>Second Round - G Robert Hunt, Louisiana.

Grade: C-</p><p>Fifth Round - DE Jason Strowbridge, North Carolina. Grade: C+</p><p>Fifth Round - OLB Curtis Weaver, Boise State. Grade: A-</p><p>Sixth Round - LB/LS Blake Ferguson, LSU. Grade: B+</p><p>Seventh Round - WR Malcolm Perry, Navy. Grade: B+</p><p>Comments: They had to take a chance on Tua in the first round. He's just too good to pass up and they better protect him. Maybe he redshirts this season or they put a bubble over him. Jackson was a reach in the mid-first round. He has some talent, but too raw to take there. Igbinoghene was also a slight reach late in the first. He does have great speed but is raw. I Would have taken Diggs there. Like Hunt's versatility and could be a future starter at guard. Love the Davis pick in the second round. Very good run stopper. Weaver was a steal in the fifth round. All he does is produce, even without great athleticism. A lot of picks and not all will hit. Some steals and a pretty good draft. But will be a great draft if Tua is able to stay healthy.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Minnesota Vikings</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: CB, WR, OL, S, Edge</p><p>First Round - WR Justin Jefferson, LSU. Grade: A-</p><p>First Round - CB Jeff Gladney, TCU. Grade: B+</p><p>Second Round - OT Ezra Cleveland, Boise State. Grade: B</p><p>Third Round - CB Cameron Dantzler, Miss. State. Grade: B-</p><p>Fourth Round - DE D.J. Wonnum, South Carolina. Grade: C</p><p>Fourth Round - DT James Lynch, Baylor. Grade: B</p><p>Fourth Round - LB Troy Dye, Oregon. Grade: A-</p><p>Fifth Round - CB Harrison Hand, Temple. Grade: B-</p><p>Fifth Round - WR K.J. Osborn, Miami. Grade: D</p><p>Sixth Round - OT Blake Brandel, Oregon State. Grade: C</p><p>Sixth Round - S Josh Metellus, Michigan. Grade: B+</p><p>Seventh Round - Edge Kenny Willekes, Michigan State. Grade: B-</p><p>Seventh Round - QB Nate Stanley, Iowa. Grade: C-</p><p>Seventh Round - S Brian Cole II, Miss. State. Grade: C+</p><p>Seventh Round - OL Kyle Hinton, Washburn. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: The Vikes were very busy in this draft with 15 picks. Jefferson was a very solid pick at 22. They needed one after they traded Stefon Diggs to gain this pick and he showed some decent speed at 4.46 at the combine. Gladney came from another deal and he should be able to fit in as a slot corner. There are some red flags, so a slight gamble. Cleveland was a strong pick in the second round. He'll be a future starter. Dye was another terrific pick. Fast and very good in coverage. Dantzler was another quality pick in the third round at corner. Lynch was one of their better picks overall. He had 13.5 sacks last year. When you have 15 picks, you better hit on at least half. I think they did better than that.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Pick: A-</strong></p><p><strong>New England Patriots</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: QB, LB, TE, WR, DL</p><p>Second Round - S Kyle Dugger, Lenoir-Rhyne. Grade: B</p><p>Second Round - Edge Josh Uche, Michigan. Grade: C</p><p>Third Round - Edge Anfernee Jennings, Alabama. Grade: B+</p><p>Third Round - TE Devin Asiasi, UCLA. Grade: C-</p><p>Third Round - TE Dalton Keene, Virginia Tech. Grade: C-</p><p>Fifth Round - PK Justin Rohrwasser, Marshall. Grade: C</p><p>Fifth Round - G Michael Onwenu, Michigan. Grade: B</p><p>Sixth Round - OT Justin Herron, Wake Forest. Grade: C-</p><p>Sixth Round - LB Cassh Maluia, Wyoming. Grade: C+</p><p>Seventh Round - C Dustin Woodard, Memphis. Grade: D+</p><p>Comments: Strange draft for the Pats. They traded out of the first round. Didn't draft a quarterback. So the assumption is they will sign or trade for one. Drafting Dugger was a risk because he's from a D2 school, but he has the size and speed to be a factor. Uche is a reach in the second round. Not great size and has to improve against the run. They went for another OLB/Edge in the third round with Jennings. He was a better pick in the third round. Smart player who fits this team well. Took two mediocre tight ends back-to-back. Taking a kicker in the fifth round was bad enough, but they didn't do enough homework on his background. A lot of picks, but few stick out as difference-makers or solid starters.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: C-</strong></p><p><strong>New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before the Draft: LB, CB, WR, OL, QB</p><p>First Round - OG Carlos Ruiz, Michigan. Grade: B+</p><p>Third Round - LB/Edge Zack Baun, Wisconsin. Grade: A-</p><p>Fourth Round - TE Adam Trautman, Dayton. Grade: A</p><p>Seventh Round - QB Tommy Stevens, Miss. State. Grade: D</p><p>Comments: Ruiz is the best guard in the draft, but could they have taken a shot with Jordan Love here? Is Taysom Hill the future at quarterback after Brees retires? Not a major need, but you can't deny the talent to play guard or even center. Baun is a first-round talent that was picked later due to a drug test issue. There are also medical concerns. The versatility and athletic ability are there. Troutman was a great pick in the fourth round. He's arguably the best or second-best tight end in a weak draft. Big and strong. Not super fast and will have to adjust from FCS. Maybe my poor grade reflected how they waited too long to draft one.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: B+</strong></p><p><strong>New York Giants</strong></p><p>Team Needs Before Draft: OT, S, RB, WR, DL</p><p>First Round - OT Andrew Thomas, Georgia. Grade: C+</p><p>Second Round - S Xavier McKinney, Alabama. Grade: A+</p><p>Third Round - OT Matt Peart, UConn. Grade: B-</p><p>Fourth Round - CB Darnay Holmes, UCLA. Grade: C+</p><p>Fifth Round - G Shane Lemieux, Oregon. Grade: B+</p><p>Sixth Round - LB Cameron Brown, Penn State. Grade: B-</p><p>Seventh Round - LB Carter Coughlin, Minnesota. Grade: C-</p><p>Seventh Round - ILB T.J. Brunson South Carolina. Grade: C+</p><p>Seventh Round - CB Chris Williamson, Minnesota. Grade: D</p><p>Seventh Round - LB Tae Crowder, Georgia. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: They did need an offensive tackle, but not sure Thomas was the right choice at four. He has good length and is a good pass blocker. Jedrick Wills was a better pick. McKinney was a steal in the second round. Had a bad 40 time so he went late, but safeties also didn't get picked high in this draft. Peart was a solid pick because that dude has good size and can play either tackle spot. He just played with a bad program. Didn't get why they didn't go for an Edge earlier in the draft.</p><p><strong>Overall Draft Grade: C+</strong></p><p><strong>New York Jets</strong></p><p>Before the Draft: Edge, OT, WR, CB, RB</p><p>First Round - OT Mekhi Becton, Louisville. Grade: B-</p><p>Second Round - WR Denzel Mims, Baylor. Grade: A</p><p>Third Round - S Ashtyn Davis, California. Grade: C+</p><p>Third Round - DL Jabari Zuniga, Florida. Grade: C</p><p>Fourth Round - RB La'Mical Perine, Florida. Grade: B+</p><p>Fourth Round - QB James Morgan, FIU. Grade: D</p><p>Fourth Round - OL Cam Clark, Charlotte. Grade: B-</p><p>Fifth Round - CB Bryce Hall, Virginia. Grade: A-</p><p>Sixth Round - P Braden Mann, Texas A&M. Grade: C-</p><p>Sixth Round - CB Quincy Wilson, UMass. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: Joe Douglas' first pick went pretty well. I should have given the Mims pick a better grade. He's worth taking there at 11. Dude has so much athletic ability at that size and yes, a receiver was needed. But they got Mims in the second round and that was a strong selection. Davis wasn't a bad pick in the third round. But safety wasn't a big need. They could have gone with OT Josh Jones and really crushed it on the offensive line. Perine in the fourth round wasn't a great pick, but he's a guy that can help as a receiver out of the backfield. I don't hate the Morgan pick quite as much, but I still don't get getting an immobile backup in the fourth round. When you have so many other needs, a quarterback is not one of them. But I think teams are picking quarterbacks higher in this draft, due to injuries (with very little preparation) and potential COVID issues.</p><p>Grade: C</p>
