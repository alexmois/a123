                        <p>After Week One, I've decided to rank all 32 NFL teams in terms of strength from top to bottom. Of course, they are subject to change, but I also analyzed each squad after their Week One performances.</p><p><h4><strong>NFL power rankings</strong></h4></p><p><strong>1)Kansas City Chiefs </strong> (last week: home WIN, 34-20 over Houston</p><p>Chiefs looked pretty good in Week 1 win over Houston by 14. As if they needed more weapons, rookie running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire with 138 yards. Meeting in Week 3 in Baltimore should be outstanding. Could they sweep the board?</p><p><strong>2)Baltimore Ravens</strong> (last week: home WIN, 38-6 over Cleveland)</p><p>The Ravens have won 13 straight regular season games and they picked off where they left off with a convincing win over Cleveland. The defense still has to work out a few kinks in terms of a pass rush and improving the run defense.</p><p><strong>3)Green Bay Packers</strong> (last week: road WIN, 43-34 over Minnesota)</p><p>Was there a more impressive win last week? The Packers went on the road and crushed the Vikings as a 1.5-point dog. Aaron Rodgers looked like the old "ARod" with 364 yards, while Davante Adams caught 14 passes for 156 yards. They also dominated time of possession 41: 16 to 18:44. The defense let down late, giving up three touchdowns in the fourth quarter.</p><p><strong>4)New Orleans Saints</strong> (last week: home WIN, 34-23 over Tampa Bay)</p><p>In the battle of 40+-year-old quarterbacks, Drew Brees came out on top. But hew threw for a pedestrian 160 yards and they ran for just 82 yards. But they picked off Tom Brady twice and their defense was the difference in this one.</p><p><strong>5)Seattle Seahawks</strong> (last week: road WIN, 38-25 over Atlanta)</p><p>Another impressive road win, this one by the Seahawks. Not sure why they wound up as a dog. They were up 31-12 in the fourth quarter, before allowing to lead scores to make the game look more competitive. Russell Wilson was fantastic, going 31 of 35 for 322 yards and four TDs. Looks like they will have to throw this season as running game might be down until Rashaad Penny returns from a knee injury and Chris Carson gets healthy.</p><p><strong>6)San Francisco 49ers</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 24-0 to Arizona)</p><p>The Niners played without their best wide receiver (Deebo Samuel) and it showed. They blew a 10-0 early lead and were up big late. The bottom line is that their formula to win is running the football and defense. They ran for 123 yards, but Jimmy Garoppolo was inconsistent, going 19 of 33 for 259 yards with two TDs.</p><p><strong>7)Tennessee Titans</strong> (last week: road WIN, 16-14 over Denver)</p><p>It's never easy winning in Denver, even if they were without Von Miller and Courtland Sutton. The Titans have to hope that Stephen Gostkowski doesn't have the yips and can make five field goals if he has to. He made the one at the end that counted, but you also have to finish drives if you are the Titans' offense.</p><p><strong>8)Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> (last week: road WIN, 26-16 over NY Giants)</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger was back last week and shook off some rust in a solid win. He threw for 229 yards with three TDs, while Benny Snell Jr. added 113 yards rushing. James Conner (ankle) is hurt again so Snell should be the new starter. The defense was good, but not dominant as the allowed 262 passing yards. They did shut down Saquon Barkley on the ground, holding him to just six yards on 15 carries.</p><p><strong>9)Buffalo Bills</strong> (last week: home WIN, 27-17 over NY Jets)</p><p>The Bils jumped out to a 21-3 lead against the Jets and never looked back. Josh Allen threw for 312 yards with 2 TDs and ran for 57 yards. Stefon Diggs caught 8 passes for 86 yards in his debut. The defense was solid and stopped the run, but this was the Jets. They meet Miami on the road this week.</p><p><strong>10)Tampa Bay Bucs</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 34-23 to New Orleans)</p><p>Losing to the Saints on the road is not a big deal. Tom Brady had two picks, though one may have been Mike Evans' fault. If they lose this week to Carolina at home, then you should start to worry about "Tompa Bay".</p><p><strong>11)Arizona Cardinals</strong> (last week: road WIN, 24-20 over San Francisco)</p><p>Overreaction? No. Arizona was going to be an improved team this season. There was no doubt about it. The addition of DeAndre Hopkins paid off in a big way this week with 14 catches for 151 yards. Will Kyler Murray become a star this season?</p><p><strong>12)New England Patriots</strong> (last week: home WIN, 21-11 over Miami)</p><p>The Pats did what they had to do beat the lowly Dolphins. The most impressive part was their defense, holding the Fins to just 269 yards of offense. Cam Newton helped New England rush for 217 yards with 75 of his own. They'll have a much tougher test this week at Seattle.</p><p><strong>13)Dallas Cowboys</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 20-17 to LA Rams)</p><p>A lot of people got off the Dallas bandwagon this week. I was never really on, but thought they could beat the mediocre Rams. Sean McVay had the better gameplan and for some reseason, Mike McCarthy went for it on 4th and 3 at the Rams 11, instead of taking the game-tying field goal in the fourth quarter.</p><p><strong>14)Minnesota Vikings</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 43-34 to Green Bay)</p><p>The Vikes just can't seem to beat the Packers. The secondary has some youth and they go exposed. The offense was asleep early on. They have a big road game against the Colts this week.</p><p><strong>15)Indianapolis Colts</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 27-27 at Jacksonville)</p><p>The Colts allowed Gardner Minshew completed 19 of 20 for 173 yards and three TDs. Philip Rivers completed 36 of 46 for 363 yards, but had two picks. They went for it on 4th and 3 at the Jax 3 and failed. Rodrigo Blankenship also missed a 30-yards field goal early in the third quarter. Too many mistakes, but they will get better.</p><p><strong>16)Philadelphia Eagles</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 27-17 at Washington)</p><p>Another decent team coming off a terrible loss at the Washington Football Team. The Eagles blew a 17-0 lead as Carson Wentz threw two picks. They should get back RT Lane Johnson and RB Miles Sanders from injuries. But Jason Peters at left tackle is going to be rough this year.</p><p><strong>17)Houston Texans</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 34-20 at Kansas City)</p><p>The schedule-maker was not too kind to Bill O'Brien, giving the Texans the Chiefs and the Ravens in back-to-back games. This should be a mediocre squad, that has issues at receiver and couldn't stop the run in the opener. They couldn't stop the run last season and they have the Ravens this week.</p><p><strong>18)LA Rams </strong>(last week: home WIN, 20-17 over Dallas)</p><p>This does not look like the Super Bowl-winning Rams team of two years ago. But they may be better than last season. They do have Jalen Ramsey and Aaron Donald on defense. But they also have Jared Goff on offense. If he can get rid of the ball quickly, the Rams can surprise some teams. They have the Eagles on the road this week.</p><p><strong>19)Atlanta Falcons</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 38-25 to Seattle)</p><p>Speaking of mediocre. Atlanta just doesn't play power football and they were hoping that Todd Gurley would supply that. But he had just 56 yards on 14 carries last week with a score.</p><p><strong>20)Chicago Bears</strong> (last week: road WIN, 27-23 over Detroit)</p><p>Let's face it. The Bears got very lucky. If D'Andre Swift catches a ball in the end zone with nobody around him, they start out 0-1. But, thanks to Mitch Trubisky's strong second half and with the NY Giants at home this week, they have a legitimate shot to start out 2-0.</p><p><strong>21)Cleveland Browns</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 38-6 to Baltimore)</p><p>The Browns should be better than this. There is already trade talk concerning Odell Beckham Jr. A loss this week against Cincinnati and then things will get worrisome. Losing to the Ravens is not a big deal, despite the spread.</p><p><strong>22)Washington Football Team</strong> (last week: home WIN, 27-17 over the Eagles)</p><p>Good win by Washington, coming back from a 17-0 defict. The offense was pedestrian, but the defense was great. Rookie DE Chase Young is going to be a beast. They took advantage of the Eagles' weak left and right tackle situation. They have a tougher test this week at Arizona.</p><p><strong>23)Las Vegas Raiders</strong> (last week: road WIN, 34-30 over Carolina)</p><p>The Raiders found a way on the road thanks to Josh Jacobs (93 yards rushing, 3 TDs, 55 yards receiving). He's become an elite back. The defense nearly blew the game and well, that's going to be an issue all season.</p><p><strong>24)Denver Broncos</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 16-14 to Tennessee)</p><p>Give the Broncos Courtland Sutton and K.J.Hamler at reciever and they might have won on Monday. But both were injured. So is OLB Von Miller, who is out for the year. Now they have a tougher task at Pittsburgh this week.</p><p><strong>25)Jacksonville Jaguars</strong> (last week: home WIN, 27-20 over Indy)</p><p>Hard to tell if the Jaguars are a lot better than people think, or the Colts choked that game away. Give them credit. Everybody though they were tanking and Gardner Minshew said hold on. We have some young guys on offense and defense that can play some. Of course, a Tennessee road win would show that they are legitimate.</p><p><strong>26)LA Chargers</strong> (last week: road WIN, 16-13 over Cincinnati)</p><p>The Bengals kicker (Randy Bullock) missed a chip shot field at the end to tie it and the Chargers are somehow 1-0. Tyrod Taylor struggled, going 16 of 30 for 208 yard. They need to score more than 16 points when you rush for 155 yards.</p><p><strong>27)Cincinnati Bengals</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 16-13 to the LA Chargers)</p><p>The Bengals are basically rebuilding with Joe Burrow at quarterback. He threw for just 193 yards with a pick, but led his team down the field in the last minute and got them in position for the game-tying field goal. They need more from Joe Mixon (69 yards) to take pressure off the rookie. They'll travel to rival Cleveland on Thursday night.</p><p><strong>28)New York Giants</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 26-16 to Pittsburgh)</p><p>The Giants didn't look bad on Monday, though they couldn't run against the Steelers. Daniel Jones threw two bad picks, but also played well at times against a very tough defense. A trip to Chicago will be tough, but winnable.</p><p><strong>29)Detroit Lions </strong>(last week: home LOSS, 27-23 to Chicago)</p><p>Some teams just find ways to lose. The Lions were up 23-6 in the fourth quarter against the Bears and blew the game in every way possible. The Swift dropped pass was devastating and he also ran for just eight yards on three carries. Adrian Peterson, at 35, led them with 93 yards on 14 attempts. A trip to Green Bay and Lambeau Field will be tough.</p><p><strong>30)Carolina Panthers</strong> (last week: home LOSS, 34-30 to Raiders)</p><p>The good news is that Teddy Bridgewater looked good, throwing for 270 yards. Robbie Anderson caught 6 passes for 115 yards. But their defense is still a major problem. It could be a long day in Tampa Bay.</p><p><strong>31)Miami Dolphins</strong> (last week: road LOSS, 21-11 to New England)</p><p>If Ryan Fitzpatrick throws three picks again this week to Buffalo, this is going to be a long season, unless Tua Tagovailoa is ready to play.</p><p><strong>32)New York Jets </strong>(last week: road LOSS, 27-17 to Buffalo)</p><p>No Le'Veon Bell. LB C.J. Mosley opted out this season. Sam Darnold is healthy but still has turnover issues. Now they have to hose the 49ers this week.</p>
