                        <p>Let's talk about the top NFL Prime Time Game in each week. There are 17 weeks of an NFL season, but just 16 weeks where there are games in prime either on Thursday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday night.</p><p>Let's start with Week One, where there are four prime time games, but the most appetizing game is on Thursday night.</p><p><h4>Week 1</h4></p><p><strong>Houston Texas at Kansas City Chiefs</strong>, Thursday, September 10.</p><p>Nothing like Deshaun Watson taking on Patrick Mahomes. These are two of the best quarterbacks in the game under 25. DeAndre Hopkins is now in Arizona, so who will be the top weapon for Watson? Brandin Cooks or Will Fuller V? Mahomes has plenty of weapons and a new rookie running back in Clyde Edwards-Helaire.</p><p><strong>Week 2</strong></p><p><strong>New England Patriots at Seattle Seahawks</strong>, Sunday, Sept. 20</p><p>Who are the Patriots? Are they going to be an average team? A sub-par squad? Come on. Bill Belichick said it on NFL Network that his squad went 11-5 without Tom Brady and Matt Cassel at quarterback. He is desperate to prove that he can win games without TB12. Seattle has a quarterback Belichick would love to have in Russell Wilson. The biggest question is who will Wilson face on the other side? Jarrett Stidham or does BB have something up his sleeve?</p><p><h4>Week 3</h4></p><p><strong>Kansas City at Baltimore</strong>, Monday, Sept. 28</p><p>These teams were supposed to meet in the AFC title game, but the Ravens lost to the Titans in the playoffs. The Chiefs appear to have the Ravens' number, but can they stop their running game? Baltimore just added another weapon in J.K. Dobbins from Ohio State and improved their defense with the addition of LBs Patrick Queen and Malik Harrison. The Ravens still need some pass rush help.</p><p><h4>Week 4</h4></p><p><strong>Philadelphia at San Francisco</strong>, Sunday, Oct. 4</p><p>This could be the preview of the NFC title game. Many thought the Eagles would be there last year, but they finished 9-7 in a pitiful NFC East. The 49ers might have overachieved last season. Their defense was sensational, but they lose DeForest Buckner on the defensive line. Will Jalen Hurts have a role on the Philly offense by now? He might have to against that very tough defense.</p><p><h4>Week 5</h4></p><p><strong>Tampa Bay at Chicago,</strong> Thursday, Oct. 8</p><p>How can I forget TOMpa Bay with Rob Gronkowski? They'll be on prime time a few times this season, but not every game is interesting. This one will be because he has to face a strong Bears defense and Khalil Mack in his grill. He'll have to get rid of the football quickly. If Nick Foles is healthy, this team could surprise in the NFC North.</p><p><h4>Week 6</h4></p><p><strong>Arizona at Dallas</strong>, Monday, Oct. 19</p><p>This is an intriguing matchup, because the Cardinals should be much-improved. Kyler Murray has another year under his belt and he now has Hopkins at receiver. So he has two big wideouts in Hopkins and Larry Fitzgerald. They don't have a great runner, but Kenyan Drake is a solid player, who can catch passes. Dallas should be tough to stop on offense with the addition of WR CeeDee Lamb, but what about their defense?</p><p><h4>Week 7</h4></p><p><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Las Vegas Raiders,</strong> Sunday, Oct. 25</p><p>Oh no, Gronk visits Las Vegas. Will he find his way to the field? It will be interesting to see how far teams try and keep their players away from the Vegas strip. The Raiders weren't a bad team last season at 7-9 and Josh Jacobs is a future star at running back. But they are in the AFC West, where mediocrity is not good enough. Being 10-6 is probably not good enough with the Chiefs around.</p><p><strong>Week 8</strong></p><p><strong>Dallas at Philadelphia,</strong> Sunday, Nov. 1</p><p>One of the biggest rivalries in the NFC. Each game means something, because it could end up deciding the division. Dallas has the firepower. The Eagles have a bunch of receivers, but no real stars. They did add Marquise Goodwin, who has shown flashes with Buffalo and San Francisco. Dallas has Lamb and Amari Cooper, to go along with Ezekiel Elliott.</p><p><h4>Week 9</h4></p><p><strong>New Orleans at Tampa Bay</strong>, Sunday, Nov. 8</p><p>This is the second of the Drew Brees vs. Brady matchups. The Bucs should be exciting this season, but is their defense good enough to slow down Brees and Michael Thomas? What role will Taysom Hill have? Will Jaemis Winston come in and play against his former team</p><p><h4>Week 10</h4></p><p><strong>Indianapolis at Tennessee,</strong> Thursday, Nov. 12</p><p>Nothing like an NFC South barnburner. Well, maybe not because the Titans want to grind this one out. Give the ball to Derrick Henry and control the clock. The Colts hope that DeForrest Buckner helps them stop Henry up the middle. Philip Rivers knows how to run a team, but will he have anything left by mid-season?</p><p><strong>Week 11</strong></p><p><strong>LA Rams at Tampa Bay,</strong> Monday, Nov. 23</p><p>Gronk and TB12 on Monday night? Another prime time game? Of course. That's what happens when you add both future Hall of Famers. The Rams might not have a future Hall of Famer on offense but they do have one on defense. His name is Aaron Donald and once again, he'll be coming after Brady all night. On offense, they added Cam Akers and dumped Todd Gurley, while trading Brandin Cooks. They'll have a lot of young guys to pair with Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods at receiver.</p><p><h4>Week 12</h4></p><p><strong>Baltimore at Pittsburgh,</strong> Thursday, Nov. 26</p><p>Happy Thanksgiving. The Ravens visit the Steelers and assuming Ben Roethlisberger doesn't get overserved during the day and is healthy, this should be a very good game. The Steelers are quietly putting together another very good defense led by T.J. Watt. Offensively, they don't need to be great, but they need to be better to get past the Ravens in the AFC North. This is where Lamar Jackson is going to have to find Mark Andrews over the middle and Hollywood Brown deep, because the Steelers will be tough to run on.</p><p><h4>Week 13</h4></p><p><strong>Buffalo at San Francisco</strong>, Monday, Dec. 7</p><p>The Bills are not going to sneak up on anybody this year. The addition of Stefon Diggs on offense should really help, but if Josh Allen doesn't improve his accuracy, he might be yearning for Kirk Cousins. The 49ers are a difficult opponent to play on a Monday night, because their defense is elite. The biggest question for Buffalo is whether they can slow down the Niners' running attack.</p><p><h4>Week 14</h4></p><p><strong>Baltimore at Cleveland,</strong> Monday, Dec. 14</p><p>The Ravens are back on another prime time game. The Ravens lost just two games in the regular season in 2020 and one of those losses came at home to the Browns. Cleveland has as much talent as anybody in the AFC. Myles Garrett is back to terrorize quarterbacks. The Browns have it all at the skill positions, but what about Baker Mayfield? If he bounces back from a sophomore slump, look out AFC North.</p><p><h4>Week 15</h4></p><p><strong>San Francisco at Dallas,</strong> Sunday, Dec. 20</p><p>There have been some classic games between these teams in the postseason. Remember the catch in 1982 made by Dwight Clark in the NFC Championship Game? These teams can meet again during the 2020 postseason. The Niners' issue starts at quarterback and their lack of explosive weapons on offense. Dallas' issues start on defense, where they need to replace Byron Jones at cornerback.</p><p><strong>Week 16</strong></p><p><strong>Tennessee at Green Bay</strong>, Sunday, Dec. 27</p><p>It's hard to go through an entire schedule and not mention the Green Bay Packers. They are not an afterthought, after going 13-3, but what a disappointing offseason. Jordan Love may be the future at quarterback for the Packers, but what about the present? They failed to give Aaron Rodgers the necessary weapons other than Devin Funchess to improve the club. The Titans are going to try and play smash-mouth football and that's not always good news for that Packers' defense.</p><p><em>(some info from ESPN.com)</em></p>
