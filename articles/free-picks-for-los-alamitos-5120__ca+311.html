                        <p><strong>Race 1</strong> on the Los Alamitos Friday race card is a 4 1/2 furlong claiming for three-year-olds and up with a purse of $7,500. Promnesia (2) has won twice and was a strong performer the last time out two weeks ago as the winner and needs to be considered here. Naomi Fraley (5) has had a solid start to a career winning twice with the best form a victory in a maiden claimer by 1 1/2 lengths at Santa Anita making her a solid choice. For My Brother (1) was respectable last time out 2 weeks ago at Los Alamitos and debuts for a new stable. <strong>Promnesia (2) to win, Exacta 2-5</strong></p><p><strong>Race 2 </strong>on the Los Alamitos card for Friday is a 1000-yard maiden for three-year-olds and up with a $12,000 purse. Awesome Alessandra (3) finished ahead of two racers in this race last time out when ending up second at a slightly shorter event which makes her the favorite. Runaway Luck (7) will take a big drop in level and finished third making a late rally at Santa Anita. Suezaaana (2) finished behind the No.3 last time out and is not expected to win but will certainly finish in the money. <strong>Awesome Alessandra (3) to win, Exacta 3-7</strong></p><p><strong>Race 3</strong> on the Los Alamitos card for Friday is a 4 1/2 furlong claiming for three-year-olds and up with a purse of $7,500. Run Heat (2) made a respectable showing the last time out 5 weeks ago at Golden Gate Fields and will be facing lesser competition in this event. WellDidYouGetIt (5) was 3rd 9 weeks ago at Turf Paradise the last time out, is in solid form upon arriving here and must not be overlooked. Tenga&rsquo;s Gold (7 ) has won once in four events including a victory at Turf Paradise second time out and is one to take very seriously. <strong>Tenga&rsquo;s Gold (7) to win, Exacta 7-2</strong></p><p>The<strong> fourth race</strong> at Los Alamitos on Friday is a 1000-yard Maiden for three-year-olds and up with a $12,000 purse. Silver Claim (8) was the runner-up finisher here, second in a race of 5 furlongs last year at Santa Anita and must be taken into consideration. Fed Hike (2) has a second-place finish in both starts and could be the horse to beat. Rossman (1) will jump out of the gate early and hope to hang on but the odds are not there. <strong>Fed Hike (2) to win, Exacta 2-8</strong></p><p><strong>Race 5</strong> at Los Alamitos on Friday is a four and a half furlong claiming for three year olds and up with a purse of $10,000. Sindy&rsquo;s Revenge (1) was victorious the first time out and finished fourth in the most recent outing but maintained solid form and needs to be considered here. Caracortada (3) was victorious the last time out five weeks ago at Los Alamitos by a large margin and cannot be overlooked. However, the horse to beat is Tengs Wonder (4) who has dropped a level in class and will race out to a lead and not be caught. <strong>Tengs Wonder (4) to win, Exacta 4-3</strong></p><p><strong>Race 6 </strong>on Friday at Los Alamitos is a 300-yard maiden for 2-year-olds with a $9,500 purse. This is a difficult race due to many new faces, but the horse to beat Nonsense Coronado (1) who has been in solid form the last few events and can outrace the field. Tearfully (9) must be considered because of a habit of starting out very quickly but often times it caught at the wire. Paint Me Fearless (3) cannot be overlooked either thanks to a strong closing pace that could possibly run down No. 1. Nonsense Coronado (1) to win, Exacta 1-3</p><p><strong>Race 7</strong> at Los Alamitos on Friday is a short 300-yard Maiden for 2-year-olds with a $9,500 purse. Watch Over Bella (1) has very promising results but against much less competition then will be in this 9-horse event. Monopolist (7) and Baby Boy Deluxe (2) are two horses that should give the No. 1 a solid race in this short sprint since both have had solid results when breaking from the gate and taking a quick lead. <strong>Watch Over Bella (1) to win, Exacta 1-2</strong></p><p>The <strong>eighth</strong> and final race on Friday at Los Alamitos Is a 350-yard allowance for three-year-olds and up with a purse of $11,825. This is a tricky race to pick as there are only six horses but ColeMan 47 (1) has set the standard amongst the six and will jump out of the gate quickly before the other five. Santander (4) has good closing speed and must be considered to finish high up in the money, why John Carter Cash (6) has threatened to finish in the money at Los Alamitos and cannot be overlooked to grab a spot in the exotics. <strong>ColeMan 47 (1) to win, Exacta 1-4</strong></p>
