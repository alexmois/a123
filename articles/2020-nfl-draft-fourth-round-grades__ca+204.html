                        <p><h4>Fourth Round</h4></p><p><strong>107)Cincinnati Bengals, OLB Akeem Davis-Gaither, Appalachian State. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: At 6-2, 224, he's on the thin side. Has short arms, but can cover and could also help as a pass rusher. Plays with good pad level. Pretty good value pick here.</p><p><strong>108) Washington Redskins, OT Saahdiq Charles, LSU. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Yes, Charles has talent, possibly late second round to early third round. He would have been a risk in those rounds, but at the top of the fourth, this isn't bad. Charles can play both tackles spots, but has short arms. Also has red flags, which is why he was picked here.</p><p><strong>109)Vegas Raiders (from Detroit) OG John Simpson, Clemson. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Simpson is 6-4, 321 with long arms and pretty good speed. Also has potential to play right tackle or center, but just played guard in college. Solid pick in the fourth round.</p><p><strong>110)New York Giants, CB Darnay Holmes, UCLA. Grade: C+</strong></p><p>Comments: Short corner at 5-10, 195 with short arms. Good speed, though doesn't play that fast Can play zone. Gets beat over the top. Most likely a nickel corner. Ran 4.48 40.</p><p><strong>111)Miami Dolphins, G Solomon Kindley, Georgia. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Ok pick here. Kindley is massive at 6-3, 337 and played in the SEC. Short arms and should do fine as a run blocker But his pass blocking is questionable. Can play either guard position.</p><p><strong>112)LA Chargers, RB Joshua Kelley, UCLA. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not a bad pick here as Kelley is 5-11, 212 with good shiftiness. Not a bad pass blocker and could eventually develop into a quality receiver out the backfield. A transfer from UC Davis.</p><p><strong>113)Carolina Panthers, CB Troy Pride Jr., Notre Dame. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Pride has shorter arms and average size at 6-0, 193. Has the speed to run with anybody. Has issues struggling to track the ball vertically. Ran a 4.4 40 at the combine.</p><p><strong>114)Arizona Cardinals, DT Leki Fotu, Utah. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Utah is having a heck of a draft. The Cards get a massive run stuffer at 6-5, 330. Still a bit raw and doesn't rush the passer well. But a run-clogger here in the fourth round is not a bad pick. Ran a 5.1 40, so he can move.</p><p><strong>115)Cleveland Browns, TE Harrison Bryant, Florida Atlantic. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Bryant was a top-five tight end and not a bad thing to get him this late. He has good speed, but not good size at 6-5, 243. Can get away from defenders, though had some issues with drops. Needs to put on at least 10 pounds.</p><p><strong>116)Jacksonville Jaguars, OT Ben Bartch, St. John's (MN). Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Nice pick with a Division III player, who is an athlete. Started out at tight end an moved to left tackle. Since he lacks the arm length for a tackle, should move to guard. Yes, he played D3, but also showed he's legit at the Senior Bowl.</p><p><strong>117)Minnesot</strong>a Vikings, DE D.J. Wonnum, South Carolina. Grade: C-</p><p>Comments: Wonnum is 6-5, 258 and a pretty lean EDGE rusher that needs some more size. Pretty good rusher, but not good against the run. Will get overpowered. Ran a 4.73 30.</p><p><strong>118)Denver Broncos, TE Albert Okwuegbunam, Missouri. Grade B-</strong></p><p>Comments: has all the speed, length and size to be elite. But he wasn't in college. Averaged just 11.8 yards per catch. Not a great route runner. But he played with Drew Lock at Missouri, so that should count for something. Ran a 4.49 40 at the combine, which is incredible for his size at 6-5, 258.</p><p><strong>119)Atlanta Falcons, LB Mykal Walker, Fresno State. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good speed and length at 6-3, 230. Can rush the passer and good in coverage. He can play outside linebacker or inside. Should also be a very good special teams player.</p><p><strong>120)New York Jets, RB La'Michal Perine, Florida. Grade: B</strong>+</p><p>Comments: Not a bad pick here as Perine is a pretty good back out of the backfield. Is 5-11, 215, but just average production as a runner. Did catch 40 passes last season with five TDs.</p><p><strong>121)Detroit Lions, OG Logan Stenberg, Kentucky. Grade: B+.</strong></p><p>Comments: Lions are having a good draft. Stenberg is a mauler at 6-6, 317 and can generate push in the running game. Not a great athlete and that's why's more guard than tackle. Could develop into a starter eventually.</p><p><strong>122)Indianapolis Colts, QB Jacob Eason, Washington. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: This was a good spot to take a quarterback for the Colts, who need to develop one behind Philip Rivers. Though they may just put Eason on the IR or make him inactive if they keep Jacoby Brissette. Eason is 6-6, 231 with great size and arm strength. He needs to become more consistent to develop into a starter at the next level and to improve his decision-making. Work ethic is a concern, but can learn a lot from Rivers.</p><p><strong>123)Dallas Cowboys, CB Reggie Robinson, Tulsa. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Good size at 6-1, 205 and had four interceptions last season. Small hands, but you have to like the size and speed. Good potential, but will need some time.</p><p><strong>124)Pittsburgh Steelers, RB Anthony McFarland, Maryland. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Steelers were desperate for a back and got a smallish one in McFarland, who averaged a ridiculous 6.7 yards per carry behind a shaky offensive line at Maryland. McFarland is just 5-8, 208 with a very good burst but is not an every-down back. Battled ankle injuries last season.</p><p><strong>125)New York Jets, QB James Morgan, FIU. Grade: D</strong></p><p>Comments: Not sure why the Jets would take a quarterback in the fourth round, with Sam Darnold as their franchise guy. Morgan is 6-4, 230 with a strong arm and good release. Has toughness, but he's streaky and his touch is iffy. Not a threat to run. His projection is as a backup, but you could have gotten him later. Did have a good Senior Bowl. This is not based on Morgan, but more about need.</p><p><strong>126)Houston Texans, OT Charlie Heck, North Carolina. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Very tall tackle at 6-8, but just 311. Has good length to block speed rushers. Needs to get bigger and work on technique.</p><p><strong>127)Philadelphia Eagles, S K'Von Wallace, Clemson. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: A bit of a reach here. Wallace is just 5-11, 205 and more of a nickel corner or safety lining up against the slot. Not great range nor is he long enough. He is tough and a pretty good tackler.</p><p><strong>128)Bufallo Bills, WR Gabriel Davis, UCF. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Has good size at 6-2, 216, but not very fast. Has good hands, but not a complete route runner. Doesn't have the speed to separate.</p><p><strong>129)New York Jets, OT Cameron Clark, Charlotte. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Clark is 6-5, 308, so has enough size to play offensive tackle. Has the length to block speed rushers and does haven edge to his game. Not a bad pick here to take a chance on a mid-major FBS tackle.</p><p><strong>130)Minnesota Vikings, DT James Lynch, Baylor. Grade: B</strong></p><p>Comments: Has the size to play defensive end or tackle. Good pass rusher, but has short arms. Average speed for an end.Had 13.5 sacks last year so very productive. Better suited for 3-technique in NFL. Played 5-technique at Baylor.</p><p><strong>131)Arizona Cardinals, DT Rashard Lawrence, LSU. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Good value pick for the Cards. They get a three-time captain who has very athletic. Not long, but has a great motor. Probably not a full-time starter, but a rotation guy who can pla 3-technique or some at the nose.</p><p><strong>132)Minnesota Vikings, LB Troy Dye, Oregon. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Is 6-3, 231 with good range. Played well despite having a cast on his hands the final eight games of the season. needs to add some size to defend tight ends but is really good in coverage. Nice pick.</p><p><strong>133)Seattle Seahawks, TE Colby Parkinson, Stanford. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick. A big target at 6-7, 252 who can grab 50-50 balls. Caught 48 passes last season. Doesn't have great speed, but could fit in well as a number two tight end, who can block. Just one drop on the year. Seventh tight end to be drafted from Stanford since 2012. That's remarkable.</p><p><strong>134)Atlanta Falcons, S Jaylinn Hawkins, California. Grade: C-</strong></p><p>Comments: Started three years at Cal. A good run stopper at 6-1, 208 has adequate range to play FS. Does have good hands and good length. Good hands as a former receiver. Needs to become more consistent in tackling.</p><p><strong>135)Pittsburgh Steelers, OG Kevin Dodson, Louisiana. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Did not go to the combine. Wasn't invited. That doesn't mean he can't play. Is 6-4, 313 with decent athletic ability. Not good length. Has some work to do in terms of technique, but strong with a nasty disposition. Started in 52 games.</p><p><strong>136)LA Rams, TE Brycen Hopkins, Purdue. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Not very big at 6-4, 245. Good runner after the catch and pretty good at running routes. He's really just a big receiver with good athleticism, but is not going to be an effective blocker.</p><p><strong>137)Jacksonville Jaguars, CB Josiah Scott, Michigan State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments:Small corner at 5-9, 185. Also has short arms and small hands. Does cover a lot of ground and is athletic. Probably ends up as a slot corner. Did have seven picks in three years.</p><p><strong>138)Kansas City Chiefs, S L'Jarius Sneed, Louisiana Tech. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Very fast safety who runs well. Very well at 4.37 40. Needs to improve his technique. Good tackler. Can also play corner at 6-1, 192. That might where he ends up. Also jumped 41 inches so the potential is there.</p><p><strong>139)Vegas Raiders, CB Amirk Robertson, Louisiana Tech. Grade:C-</strong></p><p>Comments:Undersized corner at 5-8, 187. Tough to play outside corner at that size against 6-4 wide receivers. But he is physical in press coverage and had 14 interceptions. Most likely will play slot corner.</p><p><strong>140)Jacksonville Jaguars, ILB Shaquille Quarterman, Miami-Fla. Grade:B</strong></p><p>Comments: a four-year starter who was very productive with 356 tackles and 13 sacks. Not very big at 6-1, 234. But can project to a two-down linebacker with some athletic limitations.</p><p><strong>141)Houston Texans, CB John Reid, Penn State. Grade: C</strong></p><p>Comments: Good quickness and speed. Just 5-10, 187 and not very physical. Could struggle against bigger receivers with below-average length. Also an inconsistent tackler.</p><p><strong>142)Washington Redskins, WR Antonio Gandy-Golden, Liberty. Grade:B+</strong></p><p>Comments: This is the spot where you take a chance on a 6-4, 223-pound receiver from Liberty. Is not a burner, but plays faster. Has good size and overpowered smaller defenders at Liberty. Will that translate in the NFL?</p><p><strong>143)Baltimore Ravens, OG Ben Bredeson, Michigan. Grade: B-</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens are addressing all their needs thus far. Bredson is a strong run blocker, who doesn't have great length at 6-5, 315. Will need to improve pass blocking and his lack of foot speed could make it tough against elite 3-techniques. Still like this pick because it gives them options at guard with Marshall Yanda gone.</p><p><strong>144)Seattle Seahawks, RB DeeJay Dallas, Miami-Fla. Grade: B+</strong></p><p>Comments: Like this pick. Dallas will have to work on pass blocking. Offers a strong punt returner who averaged 17.4 yards at Miami. A former receiver, so he can catch the ball out of the backfield. Also has the ability to make people miss.</p><p><strong>145)Philadelphia Eagles, OG Jack Driscoll, Auburn. Grade: A-</strong></p><p>Comments: Ravens could have chosen Driscoll at 143. He's 6-5, 306, so a little light. Lined up at right tackle in college. A two-year starter at Auburn, who played guard at UMass. Not overpowering run blocker, but better pass blocker than Bredeson. Could backup at guard and tackle. Good technique.</p><p><strong>146)Dallas Cowboys (from Eagles), C Tyler Biadasz, Wisconsin. Grade: A</strong></p><p>Comments: Very good pick. Biadasz is 6-4, 314 and a solid run blocker. Has good power. That's pretty good size for a center. Not a great athlete who struggles to get to the second level.</p><p><em>(some information via ESPN.com and ESPN)</em></p>
