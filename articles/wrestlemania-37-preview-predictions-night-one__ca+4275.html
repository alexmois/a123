                        <p>Wrestlemania 37 Preview & Predictions For Night One</p><p>Wrestlemania 37 has arrived and this year there will be fans in the stands. Just like last year, the WWE has broken down the greatest spectacle in sports entertainment into two nights. I kinda hope that they keep this format once the pandemic is over. Last year it was fun this way and it should be no different this time around. The card on both nights is loaded and in this article, I will be taking a look at Night one which will be held on Saturday night at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>Note: There are no spoilers. I have no clue as to the outcome of the matches. I stay away from the Spoiler sites as I want to be surprised with the outcome of the matches. Odds Are Courtesy Of Betonline.ag</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c4388b72-7fff-adfa-34ea-6e0f233f8cdd"></strong></p><p>Bad Bunny and Damian Priest (-950) vs. The Miz and John Morrison (+500)</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start off with what should be a fun one as recording artist Bad Bunny and his friend Damien Priest take on The Miz and Morrison. Bad Bunny has been a fan of WWE for a long time and it has been a dream of his to compete in the squared circle. He even relocated to Orlando so that he could train for this event and has shown up regularly on Raw shows. This all came about back at the Royal Rumble when Bad Bunny Was a guest musician and was approached by the Miz so they could collaborate on an album. Bad Bunny turned him down and when Miz came out for his spot in the Rumble, he destroyed Bad Bunny&rsquo;s equipment. The star then came out and got involved to the point where he took out the Miz from the top of a turnbuckle. The Miz eventually challenged BB to a match at Mania and he accepted. The Miz and Morrison have spent the last few weeks trying to get under Bad Bunny&rsquo;s skin but the recording start always had Damien Priest backing him up. This past week on Raw it all came to a head when Bad Bunny rolled up in a three-million-dollar car and Miz and Morrison deface it with red paint. Bad Bunny was not happy and then was jumped by M&M. Damien Priest got there a bit late and so it set up the pair teaming up to take on Miz and Morrison for this event. I am excited to see this match especially since I have been a huge fan of Priest since his days in NXT. The dude has plenty of potential and will make for a great star at this level. One thing I know about WWE is that normally when a Celebrity is involved they win. I can not see Damien Priest and Bad Bunny losing to Miz & Morrison in this one, especially with BB having revenge on his mind for the red paint incident. I am also excited to see what skills he has learned with all the training he has done. This should be a fun match. Prediction: Bad Bunny & Damien Priest (-950)</p><p><br />Steel Cage Match: Braun Strowman (-500) vs. Shane McMahon (+300)</p><p>If it&rsquo;s Wrestlemania then you can expect Shane McMahon to be a part of it. This one may be his last as he is facing the Monster Among Men, Braun Stroman. Shane must have a death wish as he has been egging on Braun for weeks and calling him stupid and pouring paint on him. He even brought out an oil Braun report card and made fun of all the poor grades he had on it. Shane-o-Mac has been poking the bear and now he has to pay as Braun gets him alone in a steel cage match. Shane&rsquo;s cohorts, Jackson Ryker and Elias will be locked out of the cage, but don&rsquo;t expect that to be the case for the entire match. Somehow they will find their way into the cage and give aid to Shane. This could be one of the better matches of the night as Shane is a mania and will do all he can to give the fans a great show. He has no fear and so facing the Monster Among Men in a steel cage match will not phase him at all. Shane will get his ass kicked in this one, but at some point in the match it will be three on one and that will be too much for Stroma to overcome. Prediction: Shane McMahon (+300)</p><p><br />Cesaro (-300) vs. Seth Rollins (+200)</p><p>This one will be very personal. A couple of months ago Seth Rollins came back after a little time off and he stood in the ring telling the rest of the roster that he is ready to lead WWE into the future. The Roster walked out on him all except Cesaro. He stayed and looked at Seth for a little before walking out as well. Eventually, Seth called out Cesaro and the two came to blows. Cesaro then proceeded to put Seth in the swing and swung him around 22 times. As you can guess, Seth did not take too kindly to that. Rollins has been looking to get back at Cesaro and at one point he did but Cesaro has also taken his shots as well. Cesaro is not up with Rollins&rsquo;s new vision of leading WWE into the future and he gets his chance to shut him up on the grandest stage of them all. This should be a great match and I can see WWE making a push with him. I win over Rollins would do just that. Prediction: Cesaro -300</p><p><br />Tag Team Turmoil: The Riott Squad vs. Lana and Naomi vs. Dana Brooke and Mandy Rose vs. Natalya and Tamina Snuka</p><p>There is not a ton of a storyline for this one but I will give it my best. Two teams will start off this match and once one team is eliminated, another team will enter until one is left standing. That will make for a fun match and the winner of this match will go on to face Niam and Baszler on night two for the Women&rsquo;s Tag Title. These teams have squared off against each other in one way or another the last few weeks with each having their moments. Lana and Naomi have been near the front and have had some singles matches against either Jax or Baszler. Lana and Naomi have picked up some wins. The real team to watch is Natalya and Tamina who have picked their spots of late and have decimated the competition. I cannot see the Rott Squad or Dana and Mandy winning this one. It will come down to the other two teams. The power goes to Tamina and Natalya but the momentum has to go to Lana and Naomi. Despite that, I will be going with Tamina and Natalya. They have been just picking apart teams and they have what it takes to outlast the other three teams in this match. Lansa and Naomi have had a nice little run but it ends tonight. <strong>Prediction: Natalya & Tamina</strong></p><p><strong><br />Raw Tag Team Championship Match: The New Day (+250) vs. AJ Styles and Omos (-400)</strong></p><p>TY his one should be interesting. On one side you have the New Days, which has won a million tag titles going up against the newly formed team of Aj Styles and Omos, who will be competing in his first WWE match. The experience certainly will be on the side of the New Day, but you have to give a huge power edge to AJ and Omos, who is just enormous. How will the New Day tackle this dude? They have taken on some solid teams in their career but this team may be the most intimidating one they have faced. Omos has not wrestled in a match yet but we have seen him get involved in matches or after matches and he looks unstoppable. Having said all that, the New Day are a very crafty team and they will find a way to chop the giant down and keep him from being much of a factor. The New Day recently won back their belts and I cannot see them losing so quickly, especially to a newly formed team that has one member making his in-ring debut. Prediction: The New Day (+250)</p><p><br />WWE Championship Match: Drew McIntyre (-200) vs. Bobby Lashley (+150)</p><p>This match should be an all-out war between two of the best that WWE has to offer. Last year at Wrestlemania, Drew won his first WWE title by beating Brock Lesnar in under five minutes. I am expecting this match to be much longer. Drew had held the title until losing the belt at Elimination Chamber. He actually won the chamber match to retain his title but then suffered a post-match beatdown at the hands of Lashley. That allowed The Miz to cash in his Money In The Bank briefcase and take the Title from Drew. The Miz and Lashley made a deal and if Bobby helped the Miz he would get a title shot. It happened a couple of weeks later and that was the end of Miz&rsquo;s title reight and the beginning of the almighty era. Bobby Lashley has looked unstoppable the last few months, destroying everyone that he has faced. No one has come close to stopping this guy and he has even cut ties with Shelton Benjamin and Cedric Alexander. He doesn&rsquo;t need their help anymore, but that could come back to bit him in the ass here. He is not facing any normal superstar. He is facing a pissed-off Drew McIntryre, who wants his title back. Drew has been beaten up by Lashley lately and has been put in the hurt lock numerous times. He will find a way to counter that in this one. Drew did not win his title the first time in front of fans and that will give him a bit of extra motivation in this one. This should be a great match and it will also lead to a Drew win. Prediction: Drew McIntyre -175</p><p><br />SmackDown Women's Championship Match: Bianca Belair (-400) vs. Sasha Banks (+250)</p><p>This is a match that I am very excited about. Bianca Belair is the 2021 Royal Rumble winner and that meant that she could choose any title to go after. She chose to go after the SmackDown Women&rsquo;s Title and that means a date with Sasha Banks. This should be a great match. Bianca Belair is one of the up-and-coming stars of WWE. She has power, agility and is one of the most athletically gifted superstars that the WWE has to offer. On the other side, we have Sasha Banks, who has been champion since Hell In A Cell. Banks has taken on all comers but this may be her toughest test yet. Bianca has been on a roll since moving to the main roster, after a very successful career in NXT. She has worked her ass off to get to where she is now, but so has Banks. The pair have been trading words the last few weeks and they were even tag partners at one point. They had a shot at the Tag Titles, but fell short against Nia and Baszler, thanks to interference from Reginald. Now they will finally square off in a one-on-one match and it will be the main evening of night one. Sasha has had her time as the titleholder but it is now Bianca&rsquo;s time. She has been on a roll and she has a huge power edge in this one. We will have a new champ when all is said and done. Prediction: Bianca Belair (-400)</p>
