                        <p>Each team now has at least one preseason game under their belts with two more to come. Let&rsquo;s look at our top 11 teams as we push toward week two of the preseason amidst contract squabbles and early injuries. Here are the Top 11 Gridiron Greats.</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-bd36783d-7fff-22dc-dff4-23cbaff8d39e"></strong></p><p>Gridiron Great Top 11 (Preseason Week 1)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#11. New York Jets 1-1 Preseason (+1000/+1600) - The Jets&rsquo; move to bring in Rodgers feels like it will go one of two ways: either it will be a rousing success or a colossal failure, with no in-between. Rodgers got all the tools he asked for and his a legitimate defense to play with. This may come down to the offensive line&rsquo;s ability to protect the multi-time MVP this season. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#10. Detroit Lions 1-0 Preseason (+1100/+2200) - The Lions hope to capitalize on last year&rsquo;s near-playoff run. With expectations raised, can the Lions win the wide-open NFC North Division? Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#9. Jacksonville Jaguars 1-0 Preseason (+1400/+3500) - The Jags have the coach, the QB, and the defensive line. They also have the experience of last year&rsquo;s playoff appearance and a division that is theirs for the taking. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#8. LA Chargers 1-0 Preseason (+1300/+2500) - The Chargers&rsquo; offense is one of the best in football and they&rsquo;ve added depth to the wide receiver group. The key will be the return of several key defensive players that missed time last season. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#7. Baltimore Ravens 1-0 Preseason (+1000/+1800) - The Ravens have historically been aggressive on defense and conservative on offense. This offseason, the team was quite aggressive on the offensive side of the ball, investing heavily in quarterback Lamar Jackson and several wide receivers to surround the former MVP. Jackson missed several games last season with a knee injury, In the second straight season he&rsquo;s missed significant time with injury. With the additional receivers, which include five former first-round draft picks, the Ravens may play a bit more conservatively with Jackson&rsquo;s running and more aggressively with his passing. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#6. Dallas Cowboys 1-0 Preseason (+600/+1400) - People tend to forget that, at one point late last season, the Cowboys were nearly neck and neck with the Eagles both as the best team in the NFC and the best defense in football. The Cowboys improved their defense with the addition of CB Stephon Gilmore. They have two of the NFC&rsquo;s best young defensive players in Micah Parsons and Trevon Diggs. Again, their season will come down to Dak Prescott&rsquo;s ability to perform in the playoffs. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#5. SF 49ers 0-1 Preseason (+400/+1000) - The Niners have committed to QB Brock Purdy to lead their offense just one year after doing the same with Trey Lance. Purdy proved to be more effective and mistake-free in Shanahan&rsquo;s offense but his health is a concern following shoulder surgery. The other major concern for the 49ers is the holdout of Nick Bosa. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#4. Cincinnati Bengals 1-0 Preseason (+550/+1100) - The Bengals announced this week that Burrow should be ready for week 1 with his calf injury. The Bengals should be better this season with their offensive line having a year&rsquo;s more experience and the defensive unit nearly intact. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: 4th</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#3. Buffalo Bills 1-0 Preseason (+450/+900) - The injury to Joe Burrow and his uncertainty to start the season helps the Bills leapfrog the Bengals in the AFC hierarchy. Can the Bills get over the hump this season or will they have to reassess things if they fail to get to the Super Bowl? Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#2. Philadelphia Eagles 0-1 Preseason (+250/+650) - The Eagles will have to overcome two significant things in 2023: the all-too-real Super Bowl loser hangover and the struggles of NFC East teams to repeat the previous season&rsquo;s performance. The Eagles' backfield will look different this year with the departure of RB Miles Sanders. As long as Jaylen Hurts is under center, the Eagles' running game will be sound. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Kansas City Chiefs 0-1 Preseason (+350/+600) - The defending Super Bowl champs' main objective in the preseason is to stay healthy. QB Mahomes is the league&rsquo;s best player and instantly makes a young WR group better. The team&rsquo;s main concern at this point is the health of WR Kadarius Toney and the continued holdout of DT Chris Jones. Last Week&rsquo;s Rank: -</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>Top-Five MVP Candidates - Here are five possible MVP picks to consider heading into 2023 complete with their current odds to win the award.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#1. Patrick Mahomes QB Chiefs (+700) - The 2022 MVP comes in as the favorite to win the award again this year. Mahomes will be in the running for sure with the Chiefs considering their recent dominance and he will be the primary reason why. For a safe bet, you can do worse than plunk your money down on Mahomes for MVP to start the season.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#2. Lamar Jackson QB Ravens (+1500) - Jackson bet on himself this offseason and it paid off in one of the largest contracts in NFL history. The Ravens then built an offense geared to bring him to even greater heights. He opens the season with outstanding odds, most likely due to his propensity to get injured. If he stays healthy, however, he could bring home a nice payout at this number for MVP.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#3. Justin Fields QB Bears (+2000) - Fields and the Bears could be one of the surprise teams in the NFL this season. The NFC North is wide open and Fields could prosper in his 3rd season under center. You will never get a more profitable number than this to take him for MVP.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#4. Dak Prescott QB Cowboys (+2,200) - The Cowboys have the defense to win a championship. Do they have the quarterback? Prescott has the tools and the leadership to put it all together this season. He&rsquo;ll get plenty of MVP consideration if the Cowboys can win the NFC East.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#5. Derek Carr QB Saints (+5000) - Few players have more to prove than Carr after being released by the Raiders last season and arriving in New Orleans. He has talent around him, motivation, and a very winnable division. This could be a recipe for an MVP run at excellent opening odds.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>*All odds courtesy of Draftkings.com</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>By Mark Ruelle</p><p><br /><br /></p>
