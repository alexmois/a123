                        <p><h3>Winning Willie's 6/13 CS:GO Betting Picks</h3></p><p><em><strong>*All odds courtesy of Bovada*</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>*All matches on the card are best of three*</strong></em></p><p><h3>DreamHack Masters Spring 2020: Europe</h3></p><p><h4>#7 FaZe Clan (-170) vs. #24 BIG (+130)</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: FaZe Clan -1.5</strong></p><p>These two teams enter this battle scorching hot. FaZe Clan blanked the top ranked team in the world Natus Vincere 2-0 to move into this lower bracket final. BIG came up short in their battle with the second ranked G2, losing 1-2. They have a chance to get their retribution, but they have to get through FaZe Clan first. Yes, FaZe Clan is really good and deserving of their 7th ranking, but BIG is playing too well to ignore. I can't pass up this opportunity to back BIG at a nice price.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: BIG ML (+130)</em></h4></p><p><h3>DreamHack Masters Spring 2020: North America</h3></p><p><h4>#6 Team Liquid vs. #19 Cloud9</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: Team Liquid -1.5</strong></p><p>This is an interesting matchup between two of the best teams in the North American region. These two teams met back on May 10th, with Cloud9 taking home a 2-1 win. Both squads in this battle have been shaky lately to say the least despite churning in some nice wins over top ranked teams. I feel as though Team Liquid's five man crew is playing much better than Cloud9 as a unit recently, and I expect them to sweep this contest. Cloud9 should put up a decent fight on at least one map, but I don't believe they have the firepower necessary to take a map win against Team Liquid in their current form.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: Team Liquid Spread -1.5 Maps (+150)</em></h4></p><p><h3>CS:GO Loot Cup (LOOT.BET Season 6 Grand Final)</h3></p><p><h4>#28 Heroic vs. #34 Gambit Youngsters</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: Heroic -1.5</strong></p><p>Despite the LOOT.BET Season 6 field featuring 20 solid teams, it isn't much of surprise that these two teams will meet for the Grand Final. Heroic was one of four invited teams, and they didn't play their first match in this event until the quarterfinals of the playoffs. On the other hand, Gambit Youngsters had to fight their way through the regular season portion and the playoffs starting with the Round of 12. Heroic has a very good player in niko, but Gambit Youngsters has an even-better counter with sh1ro. Gambit Youngsters has the better five man roster of these two teams, and I smell an upset brewing in this battle.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: Gambit Youngsters ML (+175)</em></h4></p><p><h3>ESL Pro League Season 12: European Qualifier</h3></p><p><h4>#20 OG (-260) vs. #35 HAVU Gaming</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: OG -1.5</strong></p><p>These two teams were less than spectacular in their upper bracket matches, and now they must fight to stay in the tournament here. Although OG has faced a couple more tougher opponents, HAVU holds a 60.7% win rate over the last three months while OG has only won 47.6% of their matches during this same period. It's been about a week since either of these teams have registered a win, and I look for this urge to win to make this battle interesting. I am on the over in this one as these two squads have been very shaky lately and neither have been consistent across a ton of maps. I have a very hard time believing that either of these teams can 2-0 each other, so I will gladly take the over at plus money.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: Over 2.5 Maps (+105)</em></h4></p><p><h4>#25 Virtus.pro (-170) vs. #36 Sprout (+125)</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: Virtus.pro -1.5</strong></p><p>This will be another interesting contest on the day. Sprout holds the better win rate over the last three months at 66%, but they have also been facing more lower-tier opponents. Virtus.pro has only won 51.4% of their matches during this same time, but almost all of these games have been against top-tier opponents. However, I am not a big fan of Virtus.pro, and their roster leaves some concern for me. Sprout has a 2-0 win over BIG in their back pocket from about two weeks ago, the same BIG team that just made easy work of Virtus.pro. I am on the German squad of Sprout in this match as I don't have any faith in Virtus.pro. Sprout doesn't give games away when they have control often, and that has been a huge issue for Virtus.pro.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: Sprout ML (+125)</em></h4></p><p><h4>#26 North vs. #81 Singularity</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: North -1.5</strong></p><p>This contest is exactly what the doctor ordered for North. Any sort of momentum that they had going from their 2-1 win over HellRaisers was erased when they were blanked 0-2 by GODSENT last match. North is a team with high expectations as they've ranked as high as third in the world at one point, and they have really been underperforming lately. Their opponent Singularity is completely outmatched in this tournament, and this was evident by the 0-2 beating that they took from Heroic in the first round of the upper bracket. Singularity has only won 35.7% of their matches over the last three months, and they don't stand a chance here either. North needs a big win to remount some momentum, and I expect them to make easy work of this lesser-tier opponent.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: North Spread -1.5 Maps (-110)</em></h4></p><p><h3>#HomeSweetHome: Week 8</h3></p><p><h4>#30 Hard Legion vs. #93 Illuminar</h4></p><p><strong>Map Spread: Hard Legion -1.5</strong></p><p>Hard Legion has been a really good team lately, but they have to be careful in this contest. Illuminar turned some heads during the group stage as they made easy work of Group C. Although Illuminar has only won 37.5% of their matches over the last three months, they've won five straight contests and appear to have turned the page. On the other hand, Hard Legion, despite being the much higher ranking team in this bout, have had a ton of trouble putting opponents away. Given Hard Legion's struggles when it comes to putting their opposition to bed, I have a hard time picturing them 2-0'ing the red-hot Illuminar in this battle.</p><p><h4><em>Pick: Over 2.5 Maps (-110)</em></h4></p>
