                        <p>NFL Draft Grades</p><p>The NFL Draft is finally over. It took three days to complete and the biggest surprise was that just one quarterback was taken through the first two rounds and just four in the first three rounds. This was not a great quarterback class on paper so the teams that desperately needed one, didn&rsquo;t reach for a need (save for Pittsburgh).</p><p>Ben Hayes takes a look at how all 32 NFL teams fared in the draft in terms of getting value and filling needs.</p><p>Arizona Cardinals</p><p>Round 2, Pick 55: Trey McBride, TE, Colorado State</p><p>Round 3, Pick 87: Cameron Thomas, DE, San Diego State</p><p>Round 3, Pick 100: Myjai Sanders, DE, Cincinnati</p><p>Round 6, Pick 201: Keontay Ingram, RB, Southern California</p><p>Round 6, Pick 215: Lecitus Smith, G, Virginia Tech</p><p>Round 7, Pick 244: Christian Matthew, CB, Valdosta State</p><p>Round 7, Pick 256: Jesse Luketa, OLB, Penn State</p><p>Round 7, Pick 257: Marquis Hayes, G, Oklahoma</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with giving up a first-round pick and getting a third rounder for WR Hollywood Brown. Knowing that DeAndre Hopkins will miss the first six games due to violating the NFL&rsquo;s Performance Enhancing Drug policy, now makes more sense. That&rsquo;s a reach for the former Oklahoma speedster who re-unites with Kyler Murray. They did add tight end Trey McBride in the second round and third-rounder Myjai Sanders in the third. Sanders is undersized but explosive. McBride has a lot of potential. Cameron Thomas is versatile and should help with the pass rush. Now understand the Brown trade, but he&rsquo;s not A.J. Brown.</p><p>Grade: C</p><p><strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p>Round 1, Pick 8: Drake London, WR, USC</p><p>Round 2, Pick 38: Arnold Ebiketie, DE, Penn State</p><p>Round 2, Pick 58: Troy Andersen, LB, Montana State</p><p>Round 3, Pick 74: Desmond Ridder, QB, Cincinnati</p><p>Round 3, Pick 82: DeAngelo Malone, EDGE, Western Kentucky</p><p>Round 5, Pick 151: Tyler Allgeier, RB, BYU</p><p>Round 6, Pick 190: Justin Shaffer, G, Georgia</p><p>Round 6, Pick 213: John FitzPatrick, TE, Georgia</p><p>Drake London is a big receiver who can run after the catch. Was he a reach when two of the Ohio State receivers were there? They are looking for the next Julio Jones and London was the closest to him in this deep WR draft. Ridder was a nice value pick in the third round and could eventually develop, though he has a lot of work to do. Atlanta ranked last in team pressure rate last season so adding Ebiketie should help. The wild card here is Andersen in the second round from FCS Montana State. He&rsquo;s off-the-charts athletically.</p><p>Grade: B+</p><p><strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong></p><p>R1 (14 &mdash; S Kyle Hamilton, Notre Dame</p><p>R1 (25) &mdash; C Tyler Linderbaum, Iowa</p><p>R2 (45) &mdash; EDGE David Ojabo, Michigan</p><p>R3 (76) &mdash; DI Travis Jones, Connecticut</p><p>R4 (110) &mdash; T Daniel Faalele, Minnesota</p><p>R4 (119) &mdash; CB Jalyn Armour-Davis, Alabama</p><p>R4 (128) &mdash; TE Charlie Kolar, Iowa State</p><p>R4 (130) &mdash; P Jordan Stout, Penn State</p><p>R4 (139) &mdash; TE Isaiah Likely, Coastal Carolina</p><p>R4 (141) &mdash; CB Damarion Williams, Houston</p><p>R6 (196) &mdash; Tyler Badie, Missouri</p><p>Baltimore likes to go for best player available and if there&rsquo;s a knock on this draft, it&rsquo;s that they didn&rsquo;t address the wide receiver and pass rush issues. They didn&rsquo;t necessarily need a safety, but they drafted Hamilton, who might be one of the best defensive players in the draft. They also drafted the best center in the draft by a mile in Linderbaum. Drafting David Ojabo in the second round was a genius move by Eric DeCosta, though he probably won&rsquo;t produce much in 2022, since he&rsquo;s coming off a ruptured Achilles&rsquo; tendon in March. They set a record with six fourth-rounders and drafted two &ldquo;move&rdquo; tight ends, who should help Lamar Jackson in the passing game. No receiver hurts this grade.</p><p>Grade: A-</p><p>Buffalo Bills</p><p>Round 1, Pick 23: Kaiir Elam, CB, Florida</p><p>Round 2, Pick 63: James Cook, RB, Georgia</p><p>Round 3, Pick 89: Terrel Bernard, LB, Baylor</p><p>Round 5, Pick 148: Khalil Shakir, WR, Boise State</p><p>Round 6, Pick 180: Matt Araiza, P, San Diego State</p><p>Round 6, Pick 185: Christian Benford, CB, Villanova</p><p>Round 6, Pick 209: Luke Tenuta, OT, Virginia Tech</p><p>Round 7, Pick 231: Baylon Spector, LB, Clemson</p><p>Buffalo didn&rsquo;t have a lot of needs coming into this one. But they did need a cornerback and found one in Kaair Elam. He has all the tools to be a dominant corner. James Cook is the younger brother of Dalvin, so he has great genes. He can also catch passes which is important in this offense, though they could have used a bigger back. Khalil Shakir is a sleeper in the third round. Araiza (Punt God) just bombs punts and is a nice value in the sixth round. Bernard is an undersized linebacker with a lot of speed, but was a reach there.</p><p>Grade: B</p><p>Carolina Panthers</p><p>R1 (6) &mdash; G Ikem Ekwonu, NC State</p><p>R3 (94) &mdash; QB Matt Corral, Mississippi</p><p>R4 (120) &mdash; LB Brandon Smith, Penn State</p><p>R6 (189) &mdash; Edge Amare Barno, Virginia</p><p>R6 (199) &mdash; T Cade Mays, Tennessee</p><p>R7 (242) &mdash; CB Kalon Barnes, Baylor</p><p>The Panthers had just six picks, but they ended up with the best lineman in the draft in Ekwonwu from NC State. Matt Corral in the third round was good value though he&rsquo;s going to take time and is not going to take over for Sam Darnold right away. Brandon Smith has the size and athleticism to be a good one, but has to show it on the field. They had just two picks in the first two rounds so it&rsquo;s tough to improve your team that way.</p><p>Grade: B+</p><p><strong>Chicago Bears</strong></p><p>R2 (39) &mdash; CB Kyler Gordon, Washington</p><p>R2 (48) &mdash; S Jaquan Brisker, Penn State</p><p>R3 (71) &mdash; WR Velus Jones Jr., Tennessee</p><p>R5 (168) &mdash; T Braxton Jones, Southern Utah</p><p>R5 (174) &mdash; EDGE Dominique Robinson, Miami (OH)</p><p>R6 (186) &mdash; T Zachary Thomas, San Diego State</p><p>R6 (203) &mdash; RB Trestan Ebner, Baylor</p><p>R6 (207) &mdash; C Doug Kramer, Illinois</p><p>R7 (226) &mdash; T Ja'Tyre Carter, Southern University</p><p>R7 (254) &mdash; S Elijah Hicks, California</p><p>R7 (255) &mdash; P Trenton Gill, North Carolina State</p><p>The Bears had a solid, but unspectacular draft. They didn&rsquo;t have a first-round pick due to trading it to the Giants to get QB Justin Fields. Gordon and Brisker improve the secondary right away. Gordon didn&rsquo;t have great combine numbers, but he got the job done on the field. Velus Jones from Tennessee is 24-years old and with great speed, but lack of production. Not sure why the Beras didn&rsquo;t add more help for Field. The rest of the draft is more about development, but that&rsquo;s what happens when you have eight third-day picks and five selections in the sixth and seventh rounds.</p><p>Grad: C</p><p>Cincinnati Bengals</p><p>Round 1, Pick 31: Daxton Hill, S, Michigan</p><p>Round 2, Pick 60: Cam Taylor-Britt, CB, Nebraska</p><p>Round 3, Pick 95: Zach Carter, DL, Florida</p><p>Round 4, Pick 136: Cordell Volson, OL, North Dakota State</p><p>Round 5, Pick 166: Tycen Anderson, S, Toledo</p><p>Round 7, Pick 252: Jeffrey Gunter, LB, Coastal Carolina</p><p>The Bengals were in the Super Bowl last season and are looking to win the first championship this season. They didn&rsquo;t have a lot of needs, but did address the secondary needs with their first two picks. Dax Hill and DB Cam Taylor-Britt are versatile enough to play several different positions. Volson was a nice pick in the fourth round as North Dakota State is a great FCS program and they produce NFL players.</p><p>Grade: B-</p><p>Cleveland Browns</p><p>Round 3, Pick 68: Martin Emerson, CB, Mississippi State</p><p>Round 3, Pick 78: Alex Wright, DE, UAB</p><p>Round 3, Pick 99: David Bell, WR, Purdue</p><p>Round 4, Pick 108: Perrion Winfrey, DT, Oklahoma</p><p>Round 4, Pick 124: Cade York, K, LSU</p><p>Round 5, Pick 156: Jerome Ford, RB, Cincinnati</p><p>Round 6, Pick 202: Mike Woods II, WR, Oklahoma</p><p>Round 7, Pick 223: Isaiah Thomas, DE, Oklahoma</p><p>Round 7, Pick 246: Dawson Deaton, OL, Texas Tech</p><p>The Browns did not have first or second-round pick, but it could be worth it if Deshaun Watson and Amari Cooper leads them to the playoffs and beyond. Emerson is a long athlete with coverage skills. Winfrey was a strong pick in the fourth round who is a 3-technique tackle who should be able to move into the rotation this year. Alex Wright has long arms and has potential as a pass rusher. David Bell ran for poor 40 times, but produced big numbers in the Big 10.</p><p>Grade: C</p><p>Dallas Cowboys</p><p>Round 1, Pick 24: Tyler Smith, OT, Tulsa</p><p>Round 2, Pick 56: Sam Williams, DE, Mississippi</p><p>Round 3, Pick 88: Jalen Tolbert, WR, South Alabama</p><p>Round 4, Pick 129: Jake Ferguson, TE, Wisconsin</p><p>Round 5, Pick 155: Matt Waletzko, OT, North Dakota</p><p>Round 5, Pick 167: DaRon Bland, CB, Fresno State</p><p>Round 5, Pick 176: Damone Clark, LB, LSU</p><p>Round 5, Pick 178: John Ridgeway, DT, Arkansas</p><p>Round 6, Pick 193: Devin Harper, LB, Oklahoma State</p><p>Dallas added a quality lineman with T/G Tyler Smith as their first pick. Not an exciting pick, but certainly something that was needed. He was a devastating run blocker and should be able to move into the left guard spot in Dallas&rsquo; zone scheme. Sam Williams is a raw talent in the second round who does fit a major need. But he&rsquo;s also one-dimensional and struggles against the run so that&rsquo;s a reach in the second round. Jalen Tolbert was a solid pick in the third round. He is a 6-2 deep threat and could eventually be in the mix at receiver.</p><p>Grade: B</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>R2 (64) &mdash; EDGE Nik Bonitto, Oklahoma</p><p>R3 (80) &mdash; TE Greg Dulcich, UCLA</p><p>R4 (115) &mdash; CB Damarri Mathis, Pittsburgh</p><p>R4 (116) &mdash; EDGE Eyioma Uwazurike, Iowa State</p><p>R5 (152) &mdash; S Delarrin Turner-Yell, Oklahoma</p><p>R5 (162) &mdash; WR Montrell Washington, Samford</p><p>R5 (171) &mdash; C Luke Wattenberg, Washington</p><p>R6 (206) &mdash; DI Matt Henningsen, Wisconsin</p><p>R7 (232) &mdash; CB Faion Hicks, Wisconsin</p><p>Denver picked up Russell Wilson in the offseason so they didn&rsquo;t need a quarterback for the first time awhile. That deal cost them their first-round pick, so they needed to hit their second and third round picks. Bonitto could eventually replace Bradley Chubb, who is a free agent at the end of the season. He&rsquo;s a solid fit for their 3-4 defense. Dulcich takes over at tight end with Noah Fant going to Seattle. He has all the tools to be a good one and was a steal in the third round. The whole draft is about getting some help for Wilson and improving defensively. It appears that they have done that.</p><p>Grade: B+</p><p>Detroit Lions</p><p>R1 (2) &mdash; EDGE Aidan Hutchinson, Michigan</p><p>R1 (12) &mdash; WR Jameson Williams, Alabama</p><p>R2 (46) &mdash; EDGE Josh Pachal, Kentucky</p><p>R3 (97) &mdash; S Kerby Joseph, Illinois</p><p>R5 (177) &mdash; TE James Mitchell, Virginia Tech</p><p>R6 (188) &mdash; LB Malcolm Rodriguez, Oklahoma State</p><p>R6 (217) &mdash; EDGE James Houston IV, Jackson State</p><p>R7 (237) &mdash; CB Chase Lucas, Arizona State</p><p>Lions get lucky as the Jags took Travon Walker. Hutchinson has the motor and size to be a start EDGE rusher. They traded up from 32 to get Jameson Williams with the 12th overall pick. He&rsquo;s a risk coming off a torn ACL, but he could be a star in the future due to great speed and route-running. Mitchell is another prospect who is coming off a torn ACL, but he could be ready by the beginning of the season. Josh Paschal is another pass rusher who could help one of the league&rsquo;s worst pass rushes</p><p>Grade: A-</p><p>Green Bay Packers</p><p>Round 1, Pick 22: Quay Walker, LB, Georgia</p><p>Round 1, Pick 28: Devonte Wyatt, DT, Georgia</p><p>Round 2, Pick 34: Christian Watson, WR, North Dakota State</p><p>Round 3, Pick 92: Sean Rhyan, OL, UCLA</p><p>Round 4, Pick 132: Romeo Doubs, WR, Nevada</p><p>Round 4, Pick 140: Zach Tom, OT, Wake Forest</p><p>Round 5, Pick 179: Kingsley Enagbare, DE, South Carolina</p><p>Round 7, Pick 228: Tariq Carpenter, LB, Georgia Tech</p><p>Round 7, Pick 234: Jonathan Ford, DT, Miami</p><p>Round 7, Pick 249: Rasheed Walker, OT, Penn State</p><p>Round 7, Pick 258: Samori Toure, WR, Nebraska</p><p>Aaron Rodgers is back, but once again, the Packers do not take a receiver in the first round or with their first two picks. Now, that Davante Adams is gone, Rodgers will have to develop chemistry with Christian Watson out of North Dakota State. The good news is that the 6-4 Watson has the size and speed to be a good one, but has to clean up the drops. Walker and Wyatt were both Georgia defenders and should be impact players. The only thing is that Walker was more reactor than one who makes plays in a great defense.</p><p>Grade: B-</p><p>Houston Texans</p><p>HOUSTON TEXANS</p><p>R1 (3) &mdash; CB Derek Stingley Jr., LSU</p><p>R1 (15) &mdash; G Kenyon Green, Texas A&M</p><p>R2 (37) &mdash; S Jalen Pitre, Baylor</p><p>R2 (44) &mdash; WR John Metchie III, Alabama</p><p>R3 (75) &mdash; LB Christian Harris, Alabama</p><p>R4 (107) &mdash; RB Dameon Pierce, Florida</p><p>R5 (150) &mdash; DI Thomas Booker, Stanford</p><p>R5 (170) &mdash;TE Teagan Quitoriano, Oregon State</p><p>R6 (205) &mdash; T Austin Deculus, LSU</p><p>Houston reached for Stingley Jr. with the third pick overall mainly because he was injured the last two seasons. When healthy, he could be a star with his great speed. Green should help on the offensive line, though he was a bit of a reach at 15. Pitre is another versatile safety who can play just about anywhere on the field. Metchie III is coming off an ACL injury and doesn&rsquo;t have a ton of upside. He does run good routes though. The key here is Stingley Jr. and of course, Houston getting better but rebuilding with no proven QB.</p><p>Grade: B+</p><p>Indianapolis Colts</p><p>R2 (53) &mdash; WR Alec Pierce, Cincinnati</p><p>R3 (73) &mdash; TE Jelani Woods, Virginia</p><p>R3 (77) &mdash; T Bernhard Raimann, Central Michigan</p><p>R3 (96) &mdash; S Nick Cross, Maryland</p><p>R5 (159) &mdash; DI Eric Johnson, Missouri State</p><p>R6 (192) &mdash; TE Andrew Ogletree, Youngstown State</p><p>R6 (216) &mdash; DI Curtis Brooks, Cincinnati</p><p>R7 (239) &mdash; S Rodney Thomas II, Yale</p><p>The Colts did not have a first-round pick thanks to a Carson Wentz deal last summer that didn&rsquo;t work out. At least they did bring in Matt Ryan and gave him a weapon on Alec Pierce. He&rsquo;s a big receiver who can go vertical and give Ryan another receiver on the outside. However, they did pass up Skyy Moore who might have been a better fit. Woods is another big, athletic tight end with questionable hands, but he can block. Cross is super athletic and a steal in the third round. Despite not having a first-round pick, it was a pretty good draft for GM Chris Ballard.</p><p>Grade: B</p><p>Jacksonville Jaguars</p><p>R1 (1) &mdash; EDGE Travon Walker, Georgia</p><p>R1 (27) &mdash; LB Devin Lloyd, Utah</p><p>R3 (65) &mdash; C Luke Fortner, Kentucky</p><p>R3 (70) &mdash; LB Chad Muma, Wyoming</p><p>R5 (154) &mdash; RB Snoop Conner, Mississippi</p><p>R6 (197) &mdash; CB Gregory Junior, Ouachita Baptist</p><p>R7 (222) &mdash; CB Montaric Brown, Arkansas</p><p>Tavon Walker will make-or break this draft. This was Trent Baalke&rsquo;s guy and if he doesn&rsquo;t work out and Aidan Hutchinson becomes a star, he should be fired. Fortunately, they spent money in free agency on WR Christian Kirk and G Brandon Scherff. Walker has the talent and length to become a star, so there is a great upside, but he didn&rsquo;t produce a lot in college. They moved up in the first round to take Devin Lloyd, who is a leader, athletic and a solid player. They went offense in the third round with center Luke Fortner, who is very athletic. Muma is a weakside linebacker who can run and chance. He&rsquo;s very good in coverage and might be the best pick for the Jags.</p><p>Grade: C-</p><p>Kansas City Chiefs</p><p>R1 (21) &mdash; CB Trent McDuffie, Washington</p><p>R1 (30) &mdash; EDGE George Karlaftis, Purdue</p><p>R2 (54) &mdash; WR Skyy Moore, Western Michigan</p><p>R2 (62) &mdash; S Bryan Cook, Cincinnati</p><p>R3 (103) &mdash; LB Leo Chenal, Wisconsin</p><p>R4 (135) &mdash; CB Joshua Williams, Fayetteville State</p><p>R5 (145) &mdash; T Darian Kinnard, Kentucky</p><p>R7 (243) &mdash; CB Jaylen Watson, Washington State</p><p>R7 (251) &mdash; RB Isaih Pacheco, Rutgers</p><p>R7 (259) &mdash; S Nazeeh Johnson, Marshall</p><p>The Chiefs are a good organization for a reason. They draft for needs, but they usually don&rsquo;t reach. They moved up to get McDuffie, one of the top corners in the draft. He&rsquo;ll probably start out in the slot. They also added Karlafis, an underrated edge rusher out of Purdue. Nobody expected for him to go 30th in the first round. They followed that with their biggest need on offense, which was receiver. Skyy Moore is only 5-10, but he is excellent after the catch, has huge hands and rarely drops passes. Cook is another huge need at safety, though he&rsquo;s more of a box safety, but does have 4.45 speed. They knocked it out of the park.</p><p>Grade: A+</p><p>Las Vegas Raiders</p><p>R3 (90) &mdash; G Dylan Parham, Memphis</p><p>R4 (122) &mdash; RB Zamir White, Georgia</p><p>R4 (126) &mdash; DI Neil Farrell Jr., LSU</p><p>R5 (175) &mdash; DI Matthew Butler, Tennessee</p><p>R7 (238) &mdash; G Thayer Munford, Ohio State</p><p>R7 (250) &mdash; RB Brittain Brown, UCLA</p><p>The Raiders hosted the draft, but they didn&rsquo;t have a pick until the third round. Getting Davante Adams certainly helps them go from playoff team to potential contender. The Raiders decided to go with line help as they took Parham from Memphis, who is a burly interior player, who should start right away. Zamir White will eventually take over for Josh Jacobs at running back. Pretty good draft considering they had no first-day picks.</p><p>Grade: B+</p><p>Los Angeles Chargers</p><p>R1 (17) &mdash; G Zion Johnson, Boston College</p><p>R3 (79) &mdash; S JT Woods, Baylor</p><p>R4 (123) &mdash; RB Isaiah Spiller, Texas A&M</p><p>R5 (160) &mdash; DI Otito Ogbonnia, UCLA</p><p>R6 (195) &mdash; T Jamaree Salyer, Georgia</p><p>R6 (214) &mdash; CB Ja'Sir Taylor, Wake Forest</p><p>R7 (236) &mdash; CB Deane Leonard, Mississippi</p><p>R7 (260) &mdash; FB Zander Horvath, Purdue</p><p>Not a very exciting draft when you take a guard mid-way through the first round. But they seriously needed help up front, especially on the right side. They could still use a right tackle, but found a very good guard in Johnson who was the best guard in the draft. Spiller is a shifty back who can back up Austin Ekeler and provide a boost of the bench. Woods has the tools to be a starter down the line, but will start out in a depth role. He has to improve as a tackler, but did have six picks in his career.</p><p>Grade: C+</p><p>Los Angeles Rams</p><p>R3 (104) &mdash; T Logan Bruss, Wisconsin</p><p>R4 (142) &mdash; CB Decobie Durant, South Carolina State</p><p>R5 (164) &mdash; RB Kyren Williams, Notre Dame</p><p>R6 (211) &mdash; S Quentin Lake, UCLA</p><p>R6 (212) &mdash; CB Derion Kendrick, Georgia</p><p>R6 (235) &mdash; EDGE Daniel Hardy, Montana State</p><p>R7 (253) &mdash; S Russ Yeast, Kansas State</p><p>R7 (261) &mdash; T AJ Arcuri, Michigan State</p><p>Another team with no picks on the first day, but it was worth it to win a Super Bowl. Logan Bruss is probably the only rookie capable of starting. He&rsquo;ll compete for a right guard spot. Kyren Williams is not only a good receiver, but he&rsquo;s one of the rare young backs that can also pass block. They also gave up a 2023 first-rounder to trade for cornerback TroyHill. CBs Decobie Durant and Derion Kendrick and S Russ Yeast should help the secondary.</p><p>Grade: B-</p><p>Miami Dolphins</p><p>R3 (102) &mdash; LB Channing Tindall, Georgia</p><p>R4 (125) &mdash; WR Erik Ezukanma, Texas Tech</p><p>R7 (224) &mdash; EDGE Cameron Goode, Cal</p><p>R7 (247) &mdash; QB Skylar Thompson, Kansas State</p><p>Not a lot you can do with four picks, but at least they wound up with star WR Tyreek Hill, so they had no first-round pick. Tindall is an excellent linebacker who can fly. He&rsquo;s pretty good value in the third round, though he is raw. Ezukanma was another solid pick in the fourth round because he can run well after the catch. Thompson is an interesting pick up late in the draft because he can really run, though is not as fast as Taysom Hill.</p><p>Draft Grade: D+</p><p>Minnesota Vikings</p><p>R1 (32) &mdash; S Lewis Cine, Georgia</p><p>R2 (42) &mdash; CB Andrew Booth Jr., Clemson</p><p>R2 (59) &mdash; G Ed Ingram, LSU</p><p>R3 (66) &mdash; LB Brian Asamoah, Oklahoma</p><p>R4 (118) &mdash; CB Akayleb Evans, Missouri</p><p>R5 (165) &mdash; EDGE Esezi Otomewo, Minnesota</p><p>R5 (169) &mdash; RB Ty Chandler, North Carolina</p><p>R6 (184) &mdash; T Vederian Lowe, Illinois</p><p>R6 (191) &mdash; WR Jalen Nailor, Michigan State</p><p>R7 (227) &mdash; TE Nick Muse, South Carolina</p><p>The Vikes had the 12th pick to traded down to 32 to pick up a second and third and also traded the 46th pic. It&rsquo;s interesting that they didn&rsquo;t go with a quarterback and focused mainly on defense in the first day and second day picks. Lewis Cine, is shocking, another Georgia defender who ran a 4.37 40 and was arguably the second-best safety after Kyle Hamilton. He&rsquo;s a very physical defender. Booth was a nice pick in the second round who can challenge for a starting job right away. He has the size and length and just needs polish. Ingram really moves people in the run game and should have an impact right away. Asamoah is a really good coverage linebacker and a nice pickup in the third round. Kwesi Adofo-Mensah did a pretty good job for his first draft.</p><p>Grade: B</p><p>New England Patriots</p><p>R1 (29) &mdash; G Cole Strange, Chattanooga</p><p>R2 (50) &mdash; WR Tyquan Thornton, Baylor</p><p>R3 (85) &mdash; CB Marcus Jones, Houston</p><p>R4 (121) &mdash; CB Jack Jones, Arizona State</p><p>R4 (127) &mdash; RB Pierre Strong Jr., South Dakota State</p><p>R4 (137) &mdash; QB Bailey Zappe, Western Kentucky</p><p>R6 (183) &mdash; RB Kevin Harris, South Carolina</p><p>R6 (200) &mdash; Edge Sam Roberts, Northwest Missouri State</p><p>R6 (210) &mdash; G Chasen Hines, LSU</p><p>R7 (245) &mdash; T Andrew Stueber, Michigan</p><p>Cole Strange was the perfect fit for this odd draft. Strange was not considered a first rounder and probably would have been a surprise if he was drafted in the second round. However, he still might develop into a starter. That&rsquo;s usually not what you do with a first-round pick. Thornton is a burner who ran a 4.28 at the NFL combine, but doesn&rsquo;t do much after the catch and rarely breaks tackles. Jones is a 5-8 corner but a very good athlete and can return kicks. At least he will be able to play in the slot. Some odd picks everywhere.</p><p>Grade: C-</p><p>New Orleans Saints</p><p>Round 1, Pick 11: Chris Olave, WR, Ohio State</p><p>Round 1, Pick 19: Trevor Penning, OT, Northern Iowa</p><p>Round 2, Pick 49: Alontae Taylor, CB, Tennessee</p><p>Round 5, Pick 161: D&rsquo;Marco Jackson, LB, Appalachian State</p><p>Round 6, Pick 194: Jordan Jackson, DT, Air Force</p><p>The Saints wanted to add an extra first-round pick so they gave up next year&rsquo;s first and a 2024 second-round pick. They found Olave, a vertical threat who is should be able to play alongside Michael Thomas. They also took one of the top tackles in Penning, who is a mauler who should have no problem replacing Terron Armstead. Alontae Taylor is fast and physical, who went from mediocre player to stud in 2021. The lack of instincts are a concern. Not a bad draft considering who few picks they had. But was it really worth it trading away so many assets?</p><p>Grade: C+</p><p>New York Giants</p><p>R1 (5) &mdash; EDGE Kayvon Thibodeaux, Oregon</p><p>R1 (7) &mdash; OT Evan Neal, Alabama</p><p>R2 (43) &mdash; WR Wan'Dale Robinson, Kentucky</p><p>R3 (67) &mdash; G Joshua Ezeudu, North Carolina</p><p>R3 (81) &mdash; CB Cordale Flott, LSU</p><p>R4 (112) &mdash; TE Daniel Bellinger, San Diego State</p><p>R4 (114) &mdash; S Dane Belton, Iowa</p><p>R4 (146) &mdash; LB Micah McFadden, Indiana</p><p>R5 (147) &mdash; DI D.J. Davidson, Arizona State</p><p>R5 (173) &mdash; G Marcus McKethan, North Carolina</p><p>R6 (182) &mdash; LB Darrian Beavers, Cincinnati</p><p>Thibodeaux is the key here. He&rsquo;s one of the most talented players in the draft and should be an impact player right away. Evan Neal is a player you can build your offensive line around. He was the best pure blocker in the draft. The rest of the draft was not great. The 5-8 Robinson is undersized and a reach in the second round. Ezeudu is a talented guard who was a slight reach but has potential and is athletic. The key was getting two potential stars in the first round.</p><p>Grade: A-</p><p>New York Jets:</p><p>Round 1, Pick 4: Ahmad &ldquo;Sauce&rdquo; Gardner, CB, Cincinnati</p><p>Round 1, Pick 10: Garrett Wilson, WR, Ohio State</p><p>Round 2, Pick 26: Jermaine Johnson II, DE, Florida State</p><p>Round 2, Pick 36: Breece Hall, RB, Iowa State</p><p>Round 3, Pick 101: Jeremy Ruckert, TE, Ohio State</p><p>Round 4, Pick 111: Max Mitchell, OT, Louisiana</p><p>Round 4, Pick 117: Micheal Clemons, DE, Texas A&M</p><p>Gardner is a stud and should have been taken as the first corner. He has the size and athleticism to be a star. The addition of Wilson was a strong pick to help young Zach Wilson (no relation). Getting Jermaine Johnson at No. 26 was a steal. He&rsquo;s a day-one starter who can be an elite pass rusher one day. Hall was the top running back though drafting runners that high is not a great move unless they are superstars. Hall will be good as he is very productive as a runner and receiver.</p><p>Grade: A+</p><p>Philadelphia Eagles</p><p>R1 (13) &mdash; DI Jordan Davis, Georgia</p><p>R2 (51) &mdash; C Cam Jurgens, Nebraska</p><p>R3 (83) &mdash; LB Nakobe Dean, Georgia</p><p>R6 (181) &mdash; Edge Kyron Johnson, Kansas</p><p>R6 (198) &mdash; TE Grant Calcaterra, SMU</p><p>Another team with limited picks. The Eagles used one of their multiple first-round picks to acquire WR A.J. Brown from the Titans. They went defense with their top pick, grabbing the very big and talented Jordan Davis. He&rsquo;s 341 pound and should be able to replace Fletcher Cox as one of the premier run-stuffers in the league. Davis has the athleticism to eventually become a pass rusher, though didn&rsquo;t show that often in Georgia. Jurgens is an athletic center and should bel able to replace Jason Kelce down the line. Nakobe Dean was a steal in the third round though he dropped due to medical reports.</p><p>Grade: A-</p><p>Pittsburgh Steelers</p><p>R1 (20) &mdash; QB Kenny Pickett, Pittsburgh</p><p>R2 (52) &mdash; WR George Pickens, Georgia</p><p>R3 (84) &mdash; Edge DeMarvin Leal, Texas A&M</p><p>R4 (138) &mdash; WR Calvin Austin III, Memphis</p><p>R6 (208) &mdash; TE Connor Heyward, Michigan State</p><p>R7 (225) &mdash; LB Mark Robinson, Mississippi</p><p>R7 (241) &mdash; QB Chris Oladokun, South Dakota State</p><p>This whole draft is about Pickett, who was not the top quarterback of a poor class. The upside went to Malik Willis, but Pickett was the only QB drafted. Was he a hometown pick? The bigger concerns are not his small hands, but his inability to get the ball away quickly. Pickens could be a steal there in the second round, though his medical history is why he was available. Leal has talent, but regressed in his final season. Austin III is a small receiver, but just makes plays. He might wind up a better pick than Pickens.</p><p>Grade: C+</p><p>San Francisco 49ers</p><p>R2 (61) &mdash; EDGE Drake Jackson, USC</p><p>R3 (93) &mdash; HB Tyrion Davis-Price, LSU</p><p>R3 (105) &mdash; WR Danny Gray, SMU</p><p>R4 (134) &mdash; T Spencer Burford, UTSA</p><p>R5 (172) &mdash; CB Samuel Womack, Toledo</p><p>R6 (187) &mdash; T Nick Zakelj, Fordham</p><p>R6 (220) &mdash; DI Kalia Davis, UCF</p><p>R6 (221) &mdash; CB Tariq Castro-Fields, Penn State</p><p>R7 (262) &mdash; QB Brock Purdy, Iowa State</p><p>The 49ers traded away their first-round pick last season to trade up for Trey Lance. Hopefully for San Francisco, Lance works out. Jackson is a strong athlete who has a ways to go in terms of improving his moves to get to the quarterback. Davis-Price could be a stud at running back and a solid complement to Elijah Mitchell. Danny Gray was a reach in the third round. Burford is a great athlete who can play tackle or guard.</p><p>Grade: C-</p><p>Seattle Seahawks</p><p>R1 (9) &mdash; OT Charles Cross, Mississippi State</p><p>R2 (40) &mdash; EDGE Boye Mafe, Minnesota</p><p>R2 (41) &mdash; RB Kenneth Walker III, Michigan State</p><p>R3 (72) &mdash; T Abraham Lucas, Washington State</p><p>R4 (109) &mdash; CB Coby Bryant, Cincinnati</p><p>R5 (153) &mdash; CB Tariq Woolen, UTSA</p><p>R5 (158) &mdash; EDGE Tyreke Smith, Ohio State</p><p>R7 (229) &mdash; WR Bo Melton, Rutgers</p><p>R7 (233) &mdash; TE Dareke Young, Lenoir-Rhyne</p><p>Cross was drafted a bit high but should start from Day One. Cross is a solid pass blocker considering he had no choice at Mississippi State, with Mike Leach throwing nearly every down. Mafe was an excellent pick up in the second round. He runs a 4.53 40 and has a 42-inch vertical so athletically he&rsquo;s off the chart and also is a productive player. Kenneth Walker is another very productive runner but why draft a solid back in the second round when you already have Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny.</p><p>Grade: C+</p><p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</p><p>R2 (33) &mdash; DI Logan Hall, Houston</p><p>R2 (57) &mdash; T Luke Goedeke, Central Michigan</p><p>R3 (91) &mdash; RB Rachaad White, Arizona State</p><p>R4 (106) &mdash; TE Cade Otton, Washington</p><p>R4 (133) &mdash; K Jake Camarda, Georgia</p><p>R5 (157) &mdash; CB Zyon McCollum, Sam Houston State</p><p>R6 (218) &mdash; TE Ko Kieft, Minnesota</p><p>R7 (248) &mdash; EDGE Andre Anthony, LSU</p><p>The Bucs traded out of the first round and found Logan Hall in the second round. He is a long pass rusher who can play all over the line. He is more of a project though is a good fit in Todd Bowles&rsquo; defense. Goedeke is a right tackle who will end up at guard to replace Ali Marpet. Cade Otton is more of a blocker and a solid pick in the fourth round.</p><p>Grade: B-</p><p>Tennessee Titans</p><p>R1 (18) &mdash; WR Treylon Burks, Arkansas</p><p>R2 (35) &mdash; CB Roger McCreary, Auburn</p><p>R3 (69) &mdash; T Nicholas Petit-Frere, Ohio State</p><p>R3 (86) &mdash; QB Malik Willis, Liberty</p><p>R4 (131) &mdash; RB Hassan Haskins, Michigan</p><p>R4 (143) &mdash; TE Chigoziem Okonkwo, Maryland</p><p>R5 (163) &mdash; WR Kyle Philips, UCLA</p><p>R6 (204) &mdash; CB Theo Jackson, Tennessee</p><p>R6 (219) &mdash; LB Chance Campbell, Mississippi</p><p>The Titans traded A.J. Brown to the Eagles for the No. 18th and 101st pick. They replaced Brown with another big receiver in Treylon Burks from Arkansas. Burks is a big receiver with speed, who needs work on his route-running. But a good pickup. Now the big question will be who will throw him the ball in 2023? That might be Malik Willis, the Liberty quarterback, who was taken in the third round, which was a steal. At least he&rsquo;ll have time to develop under Ryan Tannehill, but he certainly has the talent to be a starter one day. McCreay doesn&rsquo;t have great arm length, but he produced extremely well at Auburn.</p><p>Grade: B+</p><p>Washington Commanders</p><p>R1 (16) &mdash; WR Jahan Dotson, Penn State</p><p>R2 (47) &mdash; DI Phidarian Mathis, Alabama</p><p>R3 (98) &mdash; RB Brian Robinson Jr., Alabama</p><p>R4 (113) &mdash; S Percy Butler, Louisiana</p><p>R5 (144) &mdash; QB Sam Howell, North Carolina</p><p>R5 (149) &mdash; TE Cole Turner, Nevada</p><p>R7 (230) &mdash; T Chris Paul, Tulsa</p><p>R7 (240) &mdash; CB Christian Holmes, Oklahoma State</p><p>Never sure what this team is doing. Washington took Dotson with the 16th pick, after trading out of the No. 11 spot. Chris Olave was the player they should have taken at No. 11 instead of trading down to get Dotson, who is solid, but more of a No. 2 receiver. The second round was a slightly better pick with Mathis, who is a long defender, but doesn&rsquo;t make a huge impact. Robinson was a solid pick in the third round and is a physical runner, which the Commanders could use.</p><p>Grade: D+</p>
