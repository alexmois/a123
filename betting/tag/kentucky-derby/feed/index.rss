<p>This Saturday, May 6th, the most anticipated day in horse racing will take place at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky in the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby. With that in mind, a vast audience will not only be watching the race but, with online betting legal in several states across the country, a huge amount of first-time bettors will be anxious to take part in one of sports’ great spectacles. Here is a guide on how you can place a wager on Saturday’s event.</p>



<p><em>(If you want to crush the Derby with our free superfecta strategy,<a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/get-set-to-freakin-crush-it-at-the-kentucky-derby-parlay-bettors-all-ears-443/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/get-set-to-freakin-crush-it-at-the-kentucky-derby-parlay-bettors-all-ears-443/">&nbsp;click here</a>)</em></p>



<h3 id='how-are-the-odds-determined'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >How are The Odds Determined?</h3>



<p>Each horse will have odds assigned to it based on the likelihood of winning. Remember, in any bet, you earn back your initial investment plus your winnings. For example, if you bet $2 to win on a horse that is a 3-2 favorite, you win back your $2 and $3 for the win to take home a total of $5. In other words, you win $3 for every $2 bet. Last year, the winner, Rich Strike, went off at 80-1 so a bettor won $80 for every $1 bet on Rich Strike.</p>

<h2 id='types-of-bets-in-horse-racing'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >Types of Bets in HOrse Racing</h2>



<p>There are two types of bets in horse racing: straight bets and exotic bets. Straight bets are placed on a single horse to either win, place (2nd) or show (3rd). You can also, which I recommend, bet the same horse across the board. This simply means that you can win if your horse comes in first, second, or third. A $2 across-the-board bet on a horse will cost you $6. If your horse wins the race, you get the money paid out for first, second, and third.</p>



<p>Exotic bets are bets placed on two or more horses to finish in a specific order. The level of difficulty increases with more horses involved but the payouts are higher. In the case of Rich Strike last year, with 80-1 odds to win, an exotic bet hit in that race would pay significantly more than it would had the favorite won the race.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.twinspires.com/bet/offers/TWIN400/details?&amp;utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_medium=IncomeAccess&amp;utm_term=2870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored"><strong>Click here to sign up with TwinSpires and their $400 sign-up Bonus&nbsp;</strong></a></p>



<h3 id='here-are-examples-of-exotic-bets'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Here are examples of Exotic bets:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h5 id='exacta'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >Exacta</h5>



<p>This is a bet on two horses to finish first and second place and they have to finish in that exact order to win.</p>



<h5 id='trifecta'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >Trifecta</h5>



<p>In this case, you place a bet on three horses to finish 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and, once again, they have to finish in the exact order you bet them to win the bet.</p>



<h5 id='superfecta'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" >Superfecta</h5>



<p>Now you are betting on the exact finish of the top four horses in the race. Once again, your odds go up but you have to hit this exactly to win the bet.</p>



<h3 id='boxing-exotic-bets'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" >Boxing Exotic Bets</h3>



<p>You can also decide to ‘box’ your bet in order to increase your odds of winning. A boxed wager pays out regardless of the order you bet the horses but is more expensive because you are paying for all the scenarios. So, you can box four horses in an exacta box and win if any two of the horses finish top-2 in the race.</p>



<h2 id='early-bettors-beware'  id="boomdevs_8" class="wp-block-heading" >Early Bettors Beware</h2>



<p>One thing to keep in mind, you can certainly wager early but the odds you get for the race are the final odds that close at race time. For example, if you place a wager on Thursday prior to the race on Saturday, your horse might have odds of 26-1. However, by race time, the horse’s odds could have dropped to 4-1 based on betting interest. The 4-1 odds will be the odds you get for the race. I generally wait ten minutes or less before race time before I make my wager. This gives me a good idea of where the ‘smarts’ are putting their money and the opportunity to make a more educated bet. Either way, have fun, do some studying, and don’t bet beyond your means!</p>

<p>With the Kentucky Derby fast approaching, let’s examine another critical element of the race that could help predict the race’s outcome.

<h2 id='what-is-post-position'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >What is Post position?</h2>



<p>Post position refers to the starting gate assigned to a horse prior to the race. The positions are given based on a random draw prior to the running of the race. With twenty stalls across the track, things can get crowded. The #1 position is right near the rail. If that horse happens to get right out and hug the rail, the horse will have a shorter ride. Conversely, the 20th position is the furthest away from the rail and that horse may have trouble navigating back towards the middle of the track. Staying outside would result in the longest track to cover in the field.</p>



<p>Overall, the inside positions are more favorable since the distance to the first turn is the quickest and can allow a horse to save energy by hanging on the rail. The outside positions require a horse to exert more energy earlier in the race to get toward the middle of the track and ultimately run a longer race. The odds of a horse winning usually change based on the post position.</p>

<p>A quick look at the history of post-position wins reveals that Tapit Trice at 5-1 in the fifth position might be a solid play. Hit Show at 30-1 may be in a prime spot on the rail at the #1 post-position as well and Mage in the 8th post-position could also be profitable plays if you base things on post position. Finally, let’s all say a prayer for Derma Sotogake out of Japan who is running out of the 17th post-position. There has never been a horse to finish in the money from the 17th position in Kentucky Derby history.</p>

<p>Hey parlay bettors!&nbsp;<em><b><strong>Are you r</strong></b></em><b><strong><em>eady to score a&nbsp;massive payday at the Kentucky Derby?</em></strong></b>&nbsp;We&#8217;re here to give you the lowdown on how to turn your bets into straight-up cash. Embrace the &#8220;<em>bet small to win big</em>&#8221; concept and make the most out of&nbsp;<b><strong>our free Kentucky Derby predictions&nbsp;</strong></b>(below).</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll guide you through the ins and outs of this wild ride, from basic betting to advanced strategies like exactas and trifectas to help you make informed choices.</p>



<p>The unpredictable finishes and long-shot victories in the race&#8217;s history, such as Rich Strike (80-1), Country House (65-1), and Mine That Bird (50-1), demonstrate the potential for huge returns. To maximize your winnings, the best route is to place exotic bets such as trifectas and superfectas. These wagers have the potential to generate the highest payout.</p>



<p>For example&#8230;</p>



<h3 id='recent-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >Recent Kentucky Derby Payouts</h3>



<h5 id='2020-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >2020 Kentucky Derby Payouts</h5>



<ul>
<li>$2 Trifecta: $2,623.60</li>



<li>$2 Superfecta: $15,851.60</li>
</ul>



<h5 id='2021-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" >2021 Kentucky Derby Payouts</h5>



<ul>
<li>$2 Trifecta: $3,393.80</li>



<li>$2 Superfecta: $18,912.80</li>
</ul>



<h5 id='2022-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >2022 Kentucky Derby Payouts</h5>



<ul>
<li>$2 Trifecta: $29,741.40</li>



<li>$2 Superfecta: $64,300.20</li>
</ul>



<p>Ready to get to it? Here’s a brief breakdown of who we like and why. Below is the breakdown of exactly how to construct each ticket.&nbsp;<b><strong>Newbies welcome!</strong></b></p>



<p><b><strong>Two Phils</strong></b>&nbsp;is a horse we expect to be in the money at the Derby, thanks to its strong closing speed. Currently, at 12-1 odds, a win would yield a sizable payout.&nbsp;<b><strong>Two Phils</strong></b>&nbsp;has three starts this season, finishing in the money in each race with one win, one second, and one 3rd place. In its eight career starts, it has won four times and placed second and third once each. Jockey Jareth Loveberry has been in the money on 43% of his mounts this season, with 35 first-place finishes.</p>



<p>Next up I like&nbsp;<b><strong>Mage</strong></b>, currently projected at 15-1.&nbsp;<b><strong>Mage</strong></b>&nbsp;is trained by Gustavo Delgado, and&nbsp; has been in the money in two of his three starts, including a game second (after a bad break) to Forte in the Florida Derby., He&#8217;ll be ridden by Jockey Javier Castellano.&nbsp;<b><strong>Mage</strong></b>&nbsp;is lightly raced, but it is beautifully bred (Good Magic and a Big Brown mare), so he&#8217;ll have no trouble with the Derby distance.</p>



<p>Lastly, we favor&nbsp;<b><strong>Hit Show,</strong></b>&nbsp;another long shot at 30-1 odds. Trained by Brad Cox and ridden by the in-form jockey Manny Franco, Hit Show has demonstrated a knack for closing the gap late in races. This year, the horse has been in the money in two out of three races, with one win and one 2nd place. In its career,&nbsp;<b><strong>Hit Show</strong></b>&nbsp;has been in the money in four of its five starts, with four wins. Jockey Franco has been in the money in 57% of his mounts this year, including 93 victories. We’re also using&nbsp;<b><strong>Derma Sotogake</strong></b>&nbsp;at 40-1 odds in there too.</p>



<p>While you can opt for the safe bet with the favorite,&nbsp;<b><strong>Forte</strong></b>, a modest wager on these three horses could yield significant returns.</p>



<h3 id='how-i-would-allocate-a-$200-bet-to-make-5-figures-in-the-kentucky-derby'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >How I would Allocate a $200 Bet to make 5-figures in the Kentucky Derby</h3>



<p>Alright, here&#8217;s a breakdown of how I would allocate a $200 bet in the race to swing for the fences. Like, 5-figures!</p>



<p>If you prefer to wager only $100, simply reduce each amount by 50%, and adjust accordingly for other amounts. </p>



<p><strong>$1 Superfecta Box:</strong> Two Phils/Mage/Hit Show/Forte/Derma Sotogake= $120</p>



<p><strong>$1 Trifecta Box:</strong> Two Phils/Mage/Hit Show/Forte/Derma Sotogake=$60</p>



<p><strong>$1 Exacta Box:</strong> Two Phils/Mage/Hit Show/Forte/Derma Sotogake=$20</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are two racebooks offering generous sign-up bonuses, which you could use to potentially increase your winnings. I’ve outlined some strategies for leveraging those bonuses.</p>



<p><b><strong><u>Option #1</u></strong></b>: Leverage<b><strong>&nbsp;AmWager’s&nbsp;</strong></b>100% deposit match. An idea to take advantage of? Deposit just $50 and get a $50 match and wager the tickets above at 50%. Or deposit the full $150 and get the max $150 match and increase the above bets by 50%.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amwager.com/?amwaffid=Winnersandwhiners.com"><b><strong>Click here to sign up and AmWager will give you a 100% First Deposit Match &nbsp;Bonus, of up to $150.</strong></b></a></p>



<p><b><strong><u>Option #2</u></strong></b><b><strong>: TwinSpires&nbsp;</strong></b>is offering a $400 sign-up Bonus for new online betting accounts. Create your new wagering account by using the promo code TWIN400 and start earning your $400 bonus right away.&nbsp; Valid for one use per household.

<p>Turning $10 into $20,000 sounds too good to be true, and you’d be right if I was talking about sports. I’m talking about Horse Racing, and specifically the Kentucky Derby this weekend.</p>



<p>Know nothing about horses? That’s fine, stick with me here and I’ll explain why.</p>



<p>First, I have a sign-up offer from our partners at Daily Racing Form which will give you $10 free for just signing up. No need to deposit anything! (Offer expired, <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/articles/get-set-to-freakin-crush-it-at-the-kentucky-derby-parlay-bettors-all-ears-predictions-below__ca+8157">click here</a> for this year&#8217;s best offers.)</p>



<p>Second, I am going to give you the exact wagers that have the best chance to turn that free $10 into $20k that you can take home.</p>



<p>Still skeptical? Let me explain what makes Horse Racing different from sports betting and why I love the ponies and you should too.</p>



<h3 id='why-you-should-bet-on-horse-racing'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Why you should bet on Horse Racing</strong></h3>



<p>In horse racing, all wagers are done in a pool. The track and government take a fixed cut out of this pool, and the rest are divided up among the winners of the bet. On a normal race day, the payout is typically fairly inline with the odds. But during a big race day, the general public will throw in a lot of money on favorites as a “sure thing”. This massively inflates the pool and allows smart bettors to pocket that money.</p>



<p>See where I am going with this?</p>



<p>The Kentucky Derby is the biggest day in horse racing, which also makes it the biggest pool available. Typically more than $200,000,000 is wagered with the vast majority of that by spectators and casual bettors just wanting to turn $2 into $5 by piling on the favorite.</p>



<p>But the favorite has only won 5 out of the last 34 derbies. That’s equivalent to 8-1 odds, but the favorites are always listed as 3-1 or even 3-2. Clearly there isn’t any money to be made taking the favorite, but the public is going to do it anyway every single time.</p>



<p>That’s a good thing though, because that means the pool is bigger for the sharp bettors to cash in big.</p>



<p>This is why you can turn $10 into $20,000 during the Kentucky Derby and why I love the ponies so much!</p>



<p>I want you to get a taste of the action, especially with our friends at DRF giving you a free $10 to get started with for just signing up! (Click here to get that offer)</p>



<h3 id='my-$10-superfecta-strategy'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>My $10 Superfecta Strategy</strong></h3>



<p>In the main event, Race 12 of the Kentucky Derby, I really like the following horses:</p>



<p>#9 &#8211; Tiz the Bomb<br>#15 &#8211; White Abarrio<br>#16 &#8211; Cyber Knife<br>#6 &#8211; Messier</p>



<p>I really like #9 to win, #15 and #16 to be second or third, and #6 to be fourth. I also like horses #3, 8, and 10 as possible contenders for fourth place.</p>



<p>A $1 superfecta bet on this race is projected to pay over $20,000. So we’re going to use your free $10 to create 10 superfecta bets using these horses to increase our odds of hitting the jackpot!</p>



<p>This is what the bets look like &#8211; don’t worry, I’ll explain how to place them in a moment:</p>



<p>$1 Superfecta:<br>9 with 15, 16 with 15, 16, with 3, 6, 8, 10</p>



<p>$1 Superfecta:<br>15 with 9 with 16 with 6</p>



<p>$1 Superfecta:<br>16 with 9 with 15 with 6</p>



<p>If you were to go up to the window at Churchill Downs, you could say this to the teller and they would understand it perfectly and ask for $10 and give you your betting slips.</p>



<p>But, you can do this from the comfort of your home (legal in all states!) using DRF Bets. I’ll walk you through how to place these bets one by one.</p>



<h3 id='online-horse-betting-walkthrough'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" >Online HOrse Betting <strong>Walkthrough</strong></h3>



<p>Step 1: Use this link to sign up with DRF and get your free $10.</p>



<p>Step 2: First thing Saturday morning, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://bets.drf.com/churchill-downs">https://bets.drf.com/churchill-downs</a>&nbsp;and select race 12.</p>



<p>Step 3: Where it says “Select Wager Type”, choose “SPR”. This is for Superfecta, a bet on the top 4 places.</p>



<p>Step 4: Click “$ Enter” and enter $1 as the wager amount.</p>



<p>Step 5: Select horse 9 for 1st place.</p>



<p>Step 6: Select horse 15 and 16 for 2nd place.</p>



<p>Step 7: Select horses 15 and 16 for 3rd place.</p>



<p>Step 8: Select horses 3,6,8, and 10 for 4th place.</p>



<p>Step 9: This should give you a total wager of $8, click place bet.</p>



<p>Congratulations, you’ve just placed your first exotic ticket! All this did was create a seperate superfecta bet for each possible combination of the selections we made, which is 8 total.</p>



<p>Step 10: Return to&nbsp;<a href="https://bets.drf.com/churchill-downs">https://bets.drf.com/churchill-downs</a>&nbsp;and select race 12.</p>



<p>Step 11: Where it says “Select Wager Type”, choose “SPR”.</p>



<p>Step 12: Click “$ Enter” and enter $1 as the wager amount.</p>



<p>Step 13: Select horse 15 for 1st, horse 9 for 2nd, horse 16 for 3rd, and horse 6 for fourth.</p>



<p>Step 14: Click Place bet.</p>



<p>We placed this bet in case #15 comes in first instead of #9, pushing #16 to third. If you’re keen to put some money up, go ahead and add 3,8 and 10 for fourth to increase your chances of winning.</p>



<p>Step 15: Return to&nbsp;<a href="https://bets.drf.com/churchill-downs">https://bets.drf.com/churchill-downs</a>&nbsp;and select race 12.</p>



<p>Step 16: Where it says “Select Wager Type”, choose “SPR”.</p>



<p>Step 17: Click “$ Enter” and enter $1 as the wager amount.</p>



<p>Step 18: Select horse 16&nbsp; for 1st, horse 9 for 2nd, horse 15 for 3rd, and horse 6 for fourth.</p>



<p>Step 19: Click Place bet.</p>



<p>Like the previous bet, we’re creating this one as a contingency should #16 come in first, pushing #9 to second and #15 to third. We’d typically suggest keeping 3,8,10 as fourth place options, but that would go over our budget of $10.</p>



<p>All 10 of these bets are high risk, but we’re putting the odds in our favor both through sharp handicapping as well as sharp betting strategies.</p>



<h3 id='bonus-$50-strategy'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Bonus $50 Strategy</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re willing to put a little more money in, I would suggest this strategy for $50 budget:</p>



<p>$10 Win on 9<br>$1 Exacta Box: 9, 15, 16 ($6 total)<br>$1 Straight Trifecta: 9, 15,16 with 9,15,16, with 6,15,16 ($10)<br>$1 Straight Superfecta: 9,15,16 with 9,15,16 with 9,15,16 with 3.6,8,10, ($24)</p>



<p>The $10 winner could pay $300, the $1 exacta could pay $250, the $1 trifecta could pay $1600, and the superfecta as much as $20,000!</p>



<p>This slip pretty optimally combines the horses I feel are best to increase the odds of a winning bet paying out. If you want to bet more, I’d just increase the wager size proportionately across this strategy making your payout even bigger!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>
