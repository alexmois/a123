<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this huge matchup being played on Saturday, it is also a great time to look at the from Winners and Whiners writer <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/nfl/9-10-2023/miami-dolphins-vs-los-angeles-chargers-prediction-6643/">Eric Ploch</a></span> on a very serious, and overlooked story in the sports betting community.</p>
<h2 id='the-lessons-learned-from-iowa-student-betting-issues'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lessons Learned from Iowa student Betting Issues </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the college football season quickly approaching with the rise of online betting across the country, a concerning issue in the state of Iowa has fans thinking what their favorite teams or players might be up to. Between Iowa and Iowa State, 15 total athletes, in addition to two student managers, have been charged with misdemeanors in relation to illegal sports gambling and records tampering, according to KCCI. Once seen as a forbidden space in college athletics, it has raised questions as to where else this happening, as well as how often.</span></p>
<h2 id='caesars-sportsbook-promo-code-wawmetaget-bet-$50-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-for-any-sport'  id="boomdevs_3" ><b>Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code WAWMETAGET – Bet $50, Get $250 in Bonus Bets for any sport!</b></h2>
<p><b>To Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets deal  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </b><a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c="><b>here</b></a><b> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b05.png" alt="⬅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Iowa State, it was shocking to see their starting quarterback involved, Hunter Dekkers, who placed 366 wagers since joining the Cyclones, including on a game involving his own team. One of the most stunning bets was from Iowa football player, Aaron Blom, who allegedly placed a bet on the under in a game involving his own team, again, according to KCCI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Hawkeyes and Cyclones, questions remain as to the consequences of these actions, with Iowa State Athletic Director Jamie Pollard saying in the summer, &#8220;Iowa State cannot comment on any student-athletes’ circumstance or eligibility status. We will, however, continue to support our student-athletes as our compliance staff works with the NCAA to sort out questions surrounding their future eligibility for intercollegiate athletics competition.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting#collapseCaesars"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other schools will certainly be looking to do more diligence on the actions of their student-athletes as well, to avoid these issues in the future, especially as gambling continues to grow. It wouldn’t come as a surprise to see schools start to monitor the phones of their student-athletes or block certain sites within athletic facilities, while increased training and education is top of mind. While only a handful have been found to have done this, there’s little doubt that across the country, this is likely becoming a widespread problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of student-athletes having a stake in things or having a leg up when it comes to information or a gameplan, would skew the lines. At what point does a player take a knee or run up the score, as fans wonder if there was an ulterior motive? It will be a challenge for athletic directors to grab hold of this situation, though with all the money involved in college athletics and gambling, this is an issue that needs to find its way to the forefront. Add in the potential embarrassment of those players involved and it’ll be interesting to see how this story progresses, not only in Iowa, but across the country.</span></p>
<p><b>College Football Expert Chris King has a full breakdown with his side and total predictions for the huge matchup between Iowa at Iowa State for this Saturday.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa vs Iowa State</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday, September 9, 2023</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds at <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesars Sportsbook</a> Iowa -3.5 OU 36.5</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris states: It&#8217;s safe to say that neither team was overly impressive on the offensive side of the ball in their respective openers. With that said, at least Iowa has their starting quarterback and a few playmakers on that side of the ball. McNamara transferred from Michigan to take over the starting job with the Hawkeyes and he was solid, though unspectacular, in his team debut. Iowa State failed to impress as they failed to score over the final 28 minutes against Northern Iowa. Without Dekkers or last year’s leading rusher, Jirehl Brock, who left the team as part of the investigation, there’s not a ton to get excited about with the Cyclones. Take Iowa in what should be a rock fight as they reclaim the Cy-Hawk Trophy.</span></p>

<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-5-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_3" >Andrew Abbott Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</h3>
<p>I will be hammering Abbott’s strikeout prop in this one, as he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in five straight games and the Cardinals have continued to struggle on the road this season. They haven’t been extremely hot at the plate over their last three games either. They averaged 9.67 Ks per game in their last 3, as I see them struggling again in this one. Abbott has been solid all season and he’s going to show up in this one.</p>
<p>Take him to record Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</p>

<p>This is a MASSIVE game for the Rays and I expect Bradley to pitch deep into this game. He has also recorded at least 15 outs in four of his last five starts. He also picked up a win in his last start, as I see him picking up steam and starting to roll. It isn’t like Seattle has been this offensive powerhouse this season either. They only have the 19th highest team batting average, as I believe this game will be low scoring and tight.</p>
<p>Bradley will hang around and pitch long enough to record more than 14.5 Outs.</p>

<p>I love this spot for Kikuchi, as I have been backing him a lot lately. He is 9-5 on the season and he only has a 3.63 ERA, as this Royals batting lineup doesn’t stand a chance. They have cooled down over the last two weeks and they still have one of the worst records in baseball. Yusei has also pitched for at least six innings in four of his last six starts. He’s been a reliable starter for the Blue Jays for the last month and a half and I expect him to dominate a poor Kansas City team in this one.</p>
<p>Take Kikuchi to record more than 15.5 Outs (-125).</p>
<h3 id='parlay-odds-+359'  id="boomdevs_7" >Parlay Odds: +359</h3>
<p>Yes, these picks might look a little bit safer today, but I promise you this is a great strategy when<br />
setting up your parlays. If you can find three “Favorites” that you believe have a serious<br />
advantage, then parlay them together, and let it rip! That’s exactly what I am doing today and I expect to CASH IN BIG! So, strap in tight and get ready to ride! Let’s have a FANTASTIC<br />
Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anticipation is under way as to when the North Carolina sportsbook promo codes will be available to NC residents.</span></p>
<p>Sports betting has been legal in North Carolina since March 2021, but is currently restricted to retail sportsbooks.   The North Carolina State Lottery Commission has until June 2024 to launch online sports betting, but many sports bettors are optimistic that January 2024 is a more realistic timeline.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Irish had a great defense last year, but an inconsistent offense kept them from competing for a national Title. Now they have a powerful ground game and one of the best QBs in the nation in Sam Hartman, so you can bet that the Irish will not take their foot off the gas here. They know that they have a shot at the playoffs and can&#8217;t afford to look past anyone. Notre Dame is off an easy win against Tennessee State, and they have just Central Michigan on deck, so there is no reason for them not to be focused in this one. Notre Dame has strong edges on both sides of the ball, and they have a massive edge at QB. The Defense will shut Armstrong down while the offense puts up enough to get a solid cover in this one.</p>

<p><strong>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert NFL Football Writer Chris King states:</strong></p>
<div class="analysis">
<p>&#8220;Detroit was hot in the second half of last season but it will be a challenge for the Lions to go on the road in a hostile environment like Arrowhead to earn a win. The Lions have some holes that they hope will be patched up here but the fact remains that their secondary has a lot of questions at this point. Sure, this isn’t the Chiefs team of previous years where guys like Tyreek Hill were running free but they still have Patrick Mahomes. Plus, Andy Reid knows how to get the most out of the pieces he has to work with and that should be enough to help push the Chiefs to a home win in the opener.&#8221;</p>

<div><strong>StatSalt.com Writer Craig Forde states: </strong></div>
<div>
<div class="analysis">
<p>This is a game where I fully expect the ball to be flying from the jump. Two of the better gunslingers in the league going head-to-head to kick off the entire season and you can bet that they’ll want to put their arms on full display here. They’ll both also benefit from some thin defensive backfields to throw at. The defenses will need to be in the faces of the quarterbacks if they want to stop the pass, but both are also agile and capable of scrambling out of the pocket. The last time they met they combined to score 64 points. I expect something close to that again.</p>
<p>Take the over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ESPN has taken a giant leap into the sports gambling world by signing a licensing deal with Penn Entertainment to launch ESPN Bet. Penn was thrust into the headlines when they bought Barstool Sports, until ultimately selling the company back to its original owner, Dave Portnoy. Penn had launched Barstool Sportsbook, but will rebrand to ESPN Bet after their newest partnership. Penn is scheduled to pay ESPN $1.5 billion over the next ten years as well as buy $500 million worth of shares in the operation.</p>

<p>Disney and ESPN are continuing to move toward a direct-to-consumer model, and they believe creating ESPN Bet is giving the fans what they want. ESPN has begun to dive into the gambling world; they highlight the spread of games, air commercials for FanDuel and DraftKings, and have even created a show solely covering sports gambling called The Daily Wager. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said, &#8220;Our primary focus is always to serve sports fans and we know they want both betting content and the ability to place bets with less friction from within our products. The strategy here is simple: to give fans what they&#8217;ve been requesting and expecting from ESPN.&#8221; The launch of ESPN Bet is the next step in the progression toward fully embracing the legalization of sports gambling.</p>

<p>ESPN Bet is on schedule to be released in Fall 2023, with reports saying it will be live before Thanksgiving in an attempt to not miss much of the NFL action. The launch will include a mobile app, website, and mutually agreed upon retail locations. Penn currently has licenses to operate in 16 states – Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The new merger will attempt to get into states where Barstool fell short, including Kentucky, North Carolina, and the highly sought after market in <a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/new-york-sports-betting-soars-past-25-billion-1920/">New York.</a></p>

<p>Potential customers should be on the lookout for enticing sign-up offers when the platform goes live. ESPN has great brand recognition, but will need to give customers an incentive to join in the flooded sports gambling market. Penn offered a $1,000 deposit match bonus with Barstool Sportsbook, so a similar promotion is possible here. There may also be offers for bonus bets, odds boosts, or first bet insurance as a way to create a new customer base. ESPN Bet will merge the biggest sports network with the hottest new trend in sports to the benefit of all fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how ESPN Bet measures up with other books like <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesars Sportsbook</a>, Fan Duel, <a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/draftkings-kentucky-promo-code-1970/">Draft Kings</a>, <a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/betmgm-kentucky-bonus-code-1932/">BetMGM</a>, and BetRivers.
