<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-5-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_3" >Andrew Abbott Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</h3>
<p>I will be hammering Abbott’s strikeout prop in this one, as he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in five straight games and the Cardinals have continued to struggle on the road this season. They haven’t been extremely hot at the plate over their last three games either. They averaged 9.67 Ks per game in their last 3, as I see them struggling again in this one. Abbott has been solid all season and he’s going to show up in this one.</p>
<p>Take him to record Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</p>

<h3 id='taj-bradley-over-14-5-outs-recorded-175'  id="boomdevs_5" >Taj Bradley Over 14.5 Outs Recorded (-175)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2142" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/USATSI_21340596_168389774_lowres-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/USATSI_21340596_168389774_lowres-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/USATSI_21340596_168389774_lowres-1.jpg 384w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This is a MASSIVE game for the Rays and I expect Bradley to pitch deep into this game. He has also recorded at least 15 outs in four of his last five starts. He also picked up a win in his last start, as I see him picking up steam and starting to roll. It isn’t like Seattle has been this offensive powerhouse this season either. They only have the 19th highest team batting average, as I believe this game will be low scoring and tight.</p>
<p>Bradley will hang around and pitch long enough to record more than 14.5 Outs.</p>
<h3 id='yusei-kikuchi-over-15-5-outs-recorded-125'  id="boomdevs_6" >Yusei Kikuchi Over 15.5 Outs Recorded (-125)</h3>
<p>I love this spot for Kikuchi, as I have been backing him a lot lately. He is 9-5 on the season and he only has a 3.63 ERA, as this Royals batting lineup doesn’t stand a chance. They have cooled down over the last two weeks and they still have one of the worst records in baseball. Yusei has also pitched for at least six innings in four of his last six starts. He’s been a reliable starter for the Blue Jays for the last month and a half and I expect him to dominate a poor Kansas City team in this one.</p>
<p>Take Kikuchi to record more than 15.5 Outs (-125).</p>
<h3 id='parlay-odds-+359'  id="boomdevs_7" >Parlay Odds: +359</h3>
<p>Yes, these picks might look a little bit safer today, but I promise you this is a great strategy when<br />
setting up your parlays. If you can find three “Favorites” that you believe have a serious<br />
advantage, then parlay them together, and let it rip! That’s exactly what I am doing today and I expect to CASH IN BIG! So, strap in tight and get ready to ride! Let’s have a FANTASTIC<br />
Friday!</p>

<p>Sports betting has been legal in North Carolina since March 2021, but is currently restricted to retail sportsbooks.   The North Carolina State Lottery Commission has until June 2024 to launch online sports betting, but many sports bettors are optimistic that January 2024 is a more realistic timeline.</p>

<ul>
<li>Date: Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023</li>
<li>Time: Noon PM EST</li>
<li>Odds: Notre Dame -7.5 O/U 50.5</li>
<li><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/9-9-2023/notre-dame-vs-nc-state-prediction-5872/">David &#8220;The Dominator&#8221; Hess</a> writes:</li>
</ul>
<p>The Irish had a great defense last year, but an inconsistent offense kept them from competing for a national Title. Now they have a powerful ground game and one of the best QBs in the nation in Sam Hartman, so you can bet that the Irish will not take their foot off the gas here. They know that they have a shot at the playoffs and can&#8217;t afford to look past anyone. Notre Dame is off an easy win against Tennessee State, and they have just Central Michigan on deck, so there is no reason for them not to be focused in this one. Notre Dame has strong edges on both sides of the ball, and they have a massive edge at QB. The Defense will shut Armstrong down while the offense puts up enough to get a solid cover in this one.</p>

<p><strong>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert NFL Football Writer Chris King states:</strong></p>
<div class="analysis">
<p>&#8220;Detroit was hot in the second half of last season but it will be a challenge for the Lions to go on the road in a hostile environment like Arrowhead to earn a win. The Lions have some holes that they hope will be patched up here but the fact remains that their secondary has a lot of questions at this point. Sure, this isn’t the Chiefs team of previous years where guys like Tyreek Hill were running free but they still have Patrick Mahomes. Plus, Andy Reid knows how to get the most out of the pieces he has to work with and that should be enough to help push the Chiefs to a home win in the opener.&#8221;</p>

<div><strong>StatSalt.com Writer Craig Forde states: </strong></div>
<div>
<div class="analysis">
<p>This is a game where I fully expect the ball to be flying from the jump. Two of the better gunslingers in the league going head-to-head to kick off the entire season and you can bet that they’ll want to put their arms on full display here. They’ll both also benefit from some thin defensive backfields to throw at. The defenses will need to be in the faces of the quarterbacks if they want to stop the pass, but both are also agile and capable of scrambling out of the pocket. The last time they met they combined to score 64 points. I expect something close to that again.</p>
<p>Take the over.</p>

<p>A lot of bettors hear about bonuses, but how does it work? How can this bonus help you as a player?</p>
<p>*For example, if you win your first wager at BetMGM, you get to keep the bet and the profit. It will then become withdrawable cash.</p>
<p>*What happens if I lose my first bet? Your account will be credited with bonus bets which are equal to the amount you wagered. However, if you want to see the full $100 back in bonus bets, you are required to deposit and bet the max of $100. If you deposit and wager just $100 and it fails to win, you’ve accumulated $100 in bonus bets.</p>
<p>So even if you lose, you win! You’ll get a refund in bonus bets equal to whatever you lost, up to $100. Remember that you must use the bonus code WINNERS to claim this offer.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">In the world of sports betting, building a bankroll is something that every bettor should strive for. A bankroll is money that you have available to bet with. This money should be separate from the funds you use for daily and monthly living expenses and should not be depended on to pay rent, a mortgage, a car note, tuition, or food for your family. Setting aside a bankroll for sports betting and growing that bankroll without constantly adding money out of your personal funds is vital for long-term success.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">You can take advantage of different odds, bonuses, and promotions by having accounts with numerous books. Everyone wants to place winning bets, but winning every day is impossible. Using various books can help you build your profits by adding &#8220;free money&#8221; to your bankroll and giving you more chances to win long-term.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Each sportsbook has a unique set of bonuses. By using more sportsbooks, you have more access to bonus offers and promotions, and loyalty programs.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> You can use multiple sportsbooks to boost your bankroll by utilizing these offers. For example, you can sign up for welcome bonuses at different sportsbooks. Other benefits include ongoing promotions like cashback or reload bonuses, same-game parlay profit boosts, and occasional free bet bonus money that bettors can use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Using several sportsbooks is vital for serious players because the more sportsbooks you have, the more ability you will gain to bet frequently and place larger bets. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

While some sportsbooks may be willing to take up to a $50,000 wager for a New Giants vs. Dallas Cowboys Monday Night Football Game, another sportsbook may limit it to just a $1,000 bet for that same game. When it comes to a college basketball game between Houston Christian and Lamar, you may be limited to just a $200 bet, and sometimes even less if you consistently win. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">It is not unheard of for some bettors to be limited to only $25 bets on player props, so if you want to bet on Nikola Jokic to record over nine assists in an NBA game, you may find that the options and limits are much lower than what you run into when simply betting on a point spread or over/under. You can get around these low limits and find the best odds by having accounts with numerous books. By spreading your bets around between books, you can place more wagers and are less likely to be limited, especially if you are a big-money player who has been able to win consistently over time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It&#8217;s not fun to think about or advertise, but no sportsbook is perfect, and there is always the risk of technical glitches or other problems. By having accounts with multiple books, you can</span> <span data-contrast="none">reduce the impact of these occurrences.</span> <span data-contrast="none">If one sportsbook experiences technical difficulties, you can quickly switch to another platform and continue placing your bets without significant interruption. Using legal sportsbooks in the United States also dramatically helps you limit your risk. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>by Eric Ploch</p>
<p>It may be the NBA offseason, but several of the game&#8217;s brightest young stars are in competition with the FIBA Basketball World Cup, which gets underway on August 25th, as the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia play host to the 19th running of this international tournament.</p>

<p>After Spain took home the title in 2019, several international powers will be looking to bring home the trophy. Spain and the United States have combined to win the last four runnings of the tournament, dating back to 2006, with the United States going back-to-back in 2010 and 2014. The betting favorites remain the United States, though a host of other countries will like their chances, especially given the strong showing of the Americans in the qualifiers.</p>

<p>Team USA will play in Group C, along with Jordan, Greece, and New Zealand. While they avoid any likely tournament winners in that set of teams, they do have a few challenges to navigate. Jordan enters ranked 33rd in the world and could be the easiest of the opponents, while New Zealand sits 26th and Greece 9th. Greece will be without one of the world’s best players, Giannis Antetokounmpo, as his brother, Thanasis, will be the only NBA player on their roster. New Zealand could have Steven Adams at their disposal but would be the only NBA player on a non-U.S. team within the group.</p>
<p>The U.S. have typically treated the FIBA World Cup as a tournament as a tune-up for NBA youngsters, with this roster being no different. Steve Kerr leads the charge as head coach, while bringing 12 of the NBA’s brightest young talents to Asia. Anthony Edwards (Timberwolves) is likely the biggest name on the roster, though the emergence of Jalen Brunson (Knicks) during the playoffs, should give Kerr two experienced guards to turn to. Against Puerto Rico in their first scrimmage this summer, Edwards led the way with 15 points, while Brunson led the team with 12 rebounds. On the wings, the former Phoenix Suns duo of Mikal Bridges and Cameron Johnson bring quite a bit of experience, while Rookie of the Year Paolo Banchero, will bring some raw talent. The frontcourt remains the largest concern, as Jaren Jackson Jr. and Bobby Portis appear to be the two who’ll see the most minutes.</p>
<p>Wins against Puerto Rico and Slovenia were impressive, though their final exhibition against Spain was a great test for this team against another potential tournament favorite. It’s likely that they’ll have their way with Group C opponents, which is a big reason why they sit at -110 favorites for the tournament title, simply because they should have a prime position for the second round. That would likely have them drawn with the runner-up of their group, as well as two of Egypt, Mexico, Montenegro, and Lithuania, who likely aren’t going to present too many challenges either, though Mexico could have a few NBA talents, while Montenegro will have Nikola Vucevic (Bulls), and Lithuania could have Jonas Valanciunas (Pelicans) and Azuolas Tubelis (76ers). Once the knockout stages commence, they are likely to see two of Canada, Spain, Brazil, or France paired with them, at which point things could get interesting.</p>

<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_4" dir="ltr" ></h3>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> is a clear contender, coming in with the second-best odds behind the U.S. at -450, and have a star-studded roster. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads the way and would be a handful for the U.S., while RJ Barrett has the potential to be a strong scorer as well. Adding in experience with Kelly Olynyk and toughness in Dillon Brooks, and this is a team that the U.S. will want to avoid.</p>
<p>With <strong>France</strong> likely to bring along Rudy Gobert, Nicolas Batum, and Evan Fournier, it’s no shock that they sit +1200 to take home the title, with depth being a concern. <strong>Spain</strong> (+1400) are the reigning winners, as they’ll be leaning on the Hernangomez brothers and Santi Aldama, to lead the way. <strong>Australia</strong> (+950) could be a championship matchup, as they are likely to bring as many as ten NBA players to this tournament.</p>
<p>Anything less than a tournament title would be a failure for the U.S. However, with the sport growing exponentially globally, a few teams could give them a run for their money.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Bosun Akinpelu</span></p>
<h2 id='today-we-get-into-our-nfc-west-predictions-including-the-betting-over-under-win-totals-for-the-san-francisco-49ers-arizona-cardinals-los-angeles-rams-and-seattle-seahawks'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we get into our NFC West predictions, including the betting over/under win totals for the San Francisco 49ers, Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Rams, and Seattle Seahawks.</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1203" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19792685_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFC West was expected to be the toughest division in the NFC last season after three teams made the playoffs, with the Los Angeles Rams defeating the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game en route to winning the Super Bowl. But last season, the Rams dealt with significant injuries and missed the playoffs, and the Arizona Cardinals never got going and finished with the third-worst record in the league last season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This season, expectations in the NFC West aren’t that high, with the 49ers being the only team the oddsmakers believe will win more than nine games this season. However, with the Seattle Seahawks making a surprise playoff run last season and the Rams still having a lot of talent on their roster, don’t be surprised if the division is as tough as it was two seasons ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at the 2023-24 NFC West and our predictions for the teams’ win totals. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='arizona-cardinals-under-4-5-wins-120-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>Arizona Cardinals UNDER 4.5 WINS (-120)</b><a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049"><b style="font-size: 16px;">@DraftKings</b></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardinals finished the 2022-23 season with a 4-13 record, which was dead last in the division. Even though they haven’t used the word yet, they are essentially rebuilding after firing head coach Kliff Kingsbury. They hired former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon as his replacement, and they’re hoping he can help quarterback Kyler Murray reach his full potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardinals didn’t make a lot of big moves in free agency. They improved their offensive line with the signing of Kelvin Beachum and Will Hernandez and acquired linebacker Kyzir White from the Eagles. But they lost their top two free agents Zach Allen and Byron Murphy Jr., while J.J. Watt retired after the season. They also released wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who led the team with 717 receiving yards despite playing only nine games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona picked up some talented players in the draft, most notably former Ohio State offensive tackle Paris Johnson Jr. and former LSU linebacker BJ Ojulari, who were picked in the first two rounds, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the rest of the division, the Cardinals have the least talented roster, and they’re expected to be without Murray, who suffered a season-ending ACL injury last season, expected to miss a few games early in the season, the Cardinals will finish last in the division once again. Go with Arizona under 4.5 wins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='los-angeles-rams-over-7-5-wins-+175-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Los Angeles Rams OVER 7.5 Wins (+175) <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049">@DraftKings</a></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defending Super Bowl champions finished the 2022-23 season with a 5-12 record, which was the worst record for a defending Super Bowl champion and their first losing season in the Sean McVay era. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to their all-in approach in recent years, the Rams didn’t have a lot of room to maneuver under the salary cap and had to get rid of big contract players like Jalen Ramsey. They also let a lot of free agents walk and had to restructure a few contracts just to sign their draft picks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Rams did add some good young talent through the draft, it might not be enough to get them back in the playoffs. However, the Rams won at least nine games in each of their previous seasons under McVay prior to last season. In 2022, the team dealt with a lot of injuries on both sides and quarterback Matthew Stafford, who entered the season with an arm injury, was limited to nine games. If Stafford is healthy, they still have enough weapons to be very good offensively. They might not make the playoffs, but they will win at least eight games this season. </span></p>

<h3 id='san-francisco-49ers-under-11-5-155-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_7" ><b>San Francisco 49ers UNDER 11.5 (-155) <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049">@DraftKings</a></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 49ers finished the 2022-23 season with a 13-4 record, which was the best in the division. Even though they dealt with injuries at the quarterback position during the season, they made it to the NFC Championship Game thanks to their third-string quarterback, Brock Purdy, who went undefeated as a starter during the regular season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdy and the 49ers’ luck ran out in the NFC Championship Game after he was knocked out with an elbow injury requiring offseason surgery. Going into the season, Purdy has been declared the starter, but it’s unclear how effective he will be this year after not throwing for most of the offseason. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 49ers lost some talented players in free agency, with offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey leaving for Denver and veteran quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo signed with Las Vegas. They also brought in players like Javon Hargrave and Sam Darnold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest stories going into the season of the 49ers is the holdout of Defensive Player of the Year, Nick Bosa, who is looking for a contract extension. Even though they still have a few weeks to go before the regular season begins, they will need him on the field if they want to contend this season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco’s win total has been set at over 11.5 at +105 and under 11.5 at -125. San Francisco is one of the best teams in the league, but the quarterback situation can be a problem for them if Purdy regresses this season because the jury is still out on Trey Lance, and Sam Darnold has underachieved so far. Even though they will win at least 10 games, they won’t win 12 games this season. </span></p>
<h3 id='seattle-seahawks-over-8-5-165-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>Seattle Seahawks OVER 8.5 (-165) <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049">@DraftKings</a></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seahawks finished the 2022-23 season with a 9-8 record and made the playoffs, which surprised a lot of people after they lost quarterback Russell Wilson to Denver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geno Smith, who had backed up Wilson for two seasons, took advantage of the opportunity to be a starter once again and won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award after throwing for 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seahawks were very active in the offseason. They resigned Smith to a new contract, brought back Bobby Wagner, who played for the Rams last season, and also signed Julian Love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They used their two first-round picks to select former Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon and former Ohio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who are expected to be impact players this season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seahawks could have won more than nine games last season if a few bounces went their way. They improved their roster in the offseason and addressed most of their biggest concerns on defense, which was one of the worst last season, so expect them to win at least nine games this season.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id='afc-east-predictions'  id="boomdevs_1" >AFC East Predictions</h3>
<p>by Paul Biagioli</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1185" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21194681_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21194681_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21194681_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Buffalo Bills won the AFC East last season with a 13-3 record. Buffalo and Miami reached the playoffs, but neither advanced past the Divisional Round. The biggest news in the division was the Jets&#8217; acquisition of Aaron Rodgers, providing the team with their highest profile quarterback since Joe Namath. Buffalo has won the division the past three seasons. Will their dominance continue? Read below to see my predictions.</span></p>
<h3 id='buffalo-bills-under-10-5-wins-+130'  id="boomdevs_2" ><strong>Buffalo Bills: Under 10.5 wins (+130)</strong></h3>
<p>The Bills are overly reliant on Josh Allen to make plays, and his bruising style of running makes him an injury risk. Their defense is beginning to age, as Von Miller, Micah Hyde, and Jordan Poyer are all 32 or older. The team is trying to downplay the preseason incidents with Stefon Diggs, but it is clear not everything is right with his relationship with the team. The Bills have a grueling schedule, they play non-divisional road games against the Chiefs, Eagles, Bengals and Chargers. This will be the year the Bills take a step back.</p>
<h3 id='get-into-the-action-this-season-with-betmgm-first-bet-offer-get-up-to-$1000-paid-back-in-bonus-bets-if-you-don-t-win'  id="boomdevs_3" ><a href="https://promo.nj.betmgm.com/en/promo/geolocator?orh=promo.betmgm.com&amp;wm=7101220">Get into the action this season with BetMGM.  First Bet Offer get up to $1000 paid back in Bonus Bets if you don’t win</a></h3>
<p><a class="" role="button" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting#collapseBetMGM" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="true">Disclaimer</a></p>
<h3 id='new-york-jets-under-9-5-wins-105'  id="boomdevs_4" ><strong>New York Jets: Under 9.5 wins (-105)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding an elite quarterback will not change everything for the Jets, and it is worth questioning if Aaron Rodgers is still elite. Tom Brady was the outlier in terms of how quarterbacks can perform in their 40s, not the norm. Rodgers will turn 40 this season, and their offensive line is not strong enough to keep him on his feet all season. Something is off with Mekhi Becton, after missing all last year with an injury, he subbed himself out of their first preseason game when the medical staff cleared him to play. The skill position players are a downgrade from what Rodgers was used to in Green Bay. Don’t buy they hype, take the under. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='miami-dolphins-over-9-5-wins-+100'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>Miami Dolphins: Over 9.5 wins (+100)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFL has become a passing league, and the Dolphins have some of the fastest receivers out there. Tyreke Hill and Jaylen Waddle may be the best wideout duo in the game, and they added Braxton Berrios as a sure handed receiver to take the short yardage passes over the middle. Tua Tagovailoa was playing excellent last season before getting injured, he is back and will look to regain his form he showed early last year. Jalen Ramsey and Christian Wilkins headline an underrated defense that will be improved from last season. The Dolphins will be a surprise team in the NFL, and will hit this over.</span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_6" ></h3>
<h3 id='new-england-patriots-over-6-5-wins-140'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>New England Patriots: Over 6.5 wins (-140)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Belichick is not a coach that will embrace tanking. It doesn’t matter what next year’s quarterback crop looks like, Belichick will find ways to win games. The Patriots won games with Matt Cassell and an aging Cam Newton at the helm, they will be able to get over six wins with Mac Jones. Juju Smith-Schuster and Mike Gesicki were added to bolster their receiving corps. The biggest addition is bringing in Bill O’Brien as offensive coordinator, filling a position that was basically vacant in the previous year. This is not Tom Brady’s Patriots, but this team will be able to win at least seven of their games.</span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_8" ></h3>
<h3 id='division-winner-miami-dolphins-+300'  id="boomdevs_9" ><strong>Division Winner: Miami Dolphins (+300)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This team cannot be slowed down. Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and Raheem Mostert create on the fastest skill position groups in the league. This is year two for Mike McDaniel and offensive coordinator Frank Smith, the offense will put up big numbers behind their play scheming. Vic Fangio joins as defensive coordinator to strengthen a unit with talent at all levels. Miami will shake things up in the league, and with these odds, they are a great bet to win the AFC East. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Bosun Akinpelu</span></p>
<h2 id='our-nfl-divisional-previews-continue-with-the-2023-afc-west-predictions-including-the-over-under-betting-win-totals-for-the-broncos-chargers-raiders-and-broncos'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our NFL divisional previews continue with the 2023 AFC West predictions, including the over/under betting win totals for the Broncos, Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last season, the AFC West was expected to be the toughest division in the NFL, due to the fact that three of the four teams finished the previous season with a winning record, and the Denver Broncos pulled off a blockbuster trade for Russell Wilson.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1199" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19212704_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19212704_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19212704_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson and the Broncos failed to live up to the high expectations, and the Las Vegas Raiders, who made the playoffs the previous season, didn’t come close to making the postseason under new head coach Josh McDaniels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Kansas City Chiefs winning their second Super Bowl in five seasons, the Los Angeles Chargers winning 10 games last season, and the Denver Broncos signing Super Bowl winner Sean Payton as their head coach, expect to see a very competitive AFC West this season. Check out the team previews and over/predictions for the AFC West below. </span></p>

<h3 id='las-vegas-raiders-under-6-5-wins-135'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>Las Vegas Raiders: UNDER 6.5 WINS (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Raiders ended their five-year playoff drought in the 2021-22 season after winning 10 games, but they failed to improve on that campaign and finished the 2022-23 season with a 6-11 record, which was third in the division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the offseason, they parted ways with veteran quarterback Derek Carr and signed former San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to take over as their signal caller. Josh Jacobs, who led the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">league in rushing last season is looking for a new contract and hasn’t been with the team in training camp, putting his status for the season in limbo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They struggled defensively last season, so it wasn’t surprising that they tried to address their defensive issues through the draft, using three of their first five picks on defensive players, which they hope will make them competitive in the division this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oddsmakers weren’t impressed with the Raiders’ offseason moves and currently have their win total for the season at 6.5. The bottom line for the Raiders is that they didn’t improve at the quarterback position, they have a disgruntled running back, and their head coach hasn’t won more than eight games in a season. They also play in a division with three teams having a legitimate chance to make the playoffs, so don’t expect them to win more than six games this season. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='denver-broncos-over-8-5-wins-105'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Denver Broncos: OVER 8.5 WINS (-105)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Broncos finished the 2022-23 season with a 5-12 record, which was the worst in the conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their big offseason acquisition, Russell Wilson, who was expected to be the piece that would end their playoff drought, didn’t look comfortable under center last season and had one if the worst seasons as a pro, with the team finishing the season with fewer wins than they had the previous season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the offseason, the Broncos fired head coach Nathaniel Hackett and hired former New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, who guided the franchise to their only Super Bowl win. They are hoping he can help them resurrect the career of Wilson like he did with fellow undersized quarterback Drew Brees, who became one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history under Payton’s leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Broncos addressed their offensive line issues with the signing of two of the best free agent linemen in tackle Mike McGlinchey and guard Ben Powers. They have a lot of depth at the receiver position with Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton, with both having over 800 yards in what was the worst-scoring offense in the league. They also drafted former Oklahoma receiver Marvin Mims Jr. in the second round of the draft and expect him to contribute this season. But, they are thin at the running back position with Javonte Williams coming off a season-ending knee injury. They signed Samaje Perine to back him up, but don’t be surprised if they add another running back before the season starts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Broncos played well last season, but their offensive struggles kept the unit on the field a lot. If Payton can get the offense back on track, the Broncos will make some noise in the AFC this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver is expected to improve this season, with oddsmakers putting their total to win more than 8.5 games at -115 odds and to win less than 8.5 games at -105. Even though I expect them to be better than they were last season, they’re not going to be as good as the Chiefs or Chargers, but they will be good enough to win nine games.</span></p>
<h3 id='los-angeles-chargers-over-9-5-wins-115'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Los Angeles Chargers: OVER 9.5 WINS (-115)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chargers finished the 2022-23 season with a 10-7 record, but they were eliminated by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wildcard round of the playoffs. They were just as good as expected offensively, but the defense didn’t live up to the preseason hype, and they weren’t able to overcome all the injuries they dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This offseason, the Chargers didn’t make a splash, but they brought in veterans like linebacker Eric Kendricks and used their first-round pick on receiver Quentin Johnston, who is expected to have an impact on their offense this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they play like they did last season, the Chargers won’t have trouble with keeping up with most teams offensively, and if their defensive stars can stay healthy this season, they might give the Chiefs a run for the AFC West title.</span></p>
<h2 id='every-point-matters-in-the-nfl-so-you-want-to-have-access-to-multiple-sportsbooks-take-advantage-of-the-limited-time-first-time-deposit-bonuses-here'  id="boomdevs_7" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every point matters in the NFL, so you want to have access to multiple </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sportsbooks.

<h3 id='kansas-city-chiefs-over-11-5-wins-135'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>Kansas City Chiefs: OVER 11.5 WINS (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kansas City Chiefs finished the 2022-23 season with a 14-3 record, winning the AFC West for the seventh consecutive season and picking up their second Super Bowl win in five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chiefs come into the season with most of their offensive core intact, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. Seventh-round pick Isiah Pacheco emerged as a legitimate RB1 last season after finishing with 830 yards and five touchdowns as a rookie last season. They lost wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster in the offseason, but they are high on second-round draft pick Rashee Rice and don’t expect to miss much of a beat offensively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On defense, they released Frank Clark, who had a big contract and finished with only five sacks last season. They are hoping first-round pick Felix Anudike-Uzomah will be more productive than he was.</span></p>
<h2 id='division-winner-kansas-city-chiefs-180'  id="boomdevs_9" ><b>Division Winner: Kansas City Chiefs (-180)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas City’s win total is currently at 11.5 at -110 odds to go over and -110 odds to finish under. Considering the fact that they have at least 12 wins in five straight seasons and no other teams in the AFC West have done enough to be considered legitimate threats to them, the Chiefs will not only pick up more than 11.5 wins this season but also win the AFC West.</span></p>
