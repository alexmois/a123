<h3 id='sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_3" ><strong>SEC Champion Prediction: LSU Tigers (+460) @ <a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As has been the case for several seasons, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is loaded with talented teams in both the East and West divisions. The defending National Champion Georgia Bulldogs (-110) will win the East Division. I then expect Georgia to face the LSU Tigers (+450) in the conference Championship game, with the Tigers prevailing.  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1313" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1313" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-medium wp-image-1313" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19372620_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19372620_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19372620_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1313" class="wp-caption-text">Nov 5, 2022; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA; LSU Tigers quarterback Jayden Daniels (5) is tackled by Alabama Crimson Tide defensive lineman DJ Dale (94) and linebacker Chris Braswell (41) during the second half at Tiger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LSU Quarterback Jayden Daniels will begin his second season under head coach Brian Kelly, and the offensive line should be much stronger than last season. The Tigers’ receiving corps, led by Malik Nabers (wide receiver) and Mason Taylor (tight end ), is one of the conference’s best. LSU has to play Alabama (+240) on the road, but the Tigers will prevail and win the division.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LSU defense gave up just 22.5 points per game last season and this season is even stronger upfront as Maason Smith is back following a knee injury that left him sidelined for most of the season last year. Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU&#8217;s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2 id='over-under-win-total-best-bets'  id="boomdevs_4" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over/Under Win Total Best Bets:</span></h2>
<h3 id='kentucky-wildcats-over-7'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>Kentucky Wildcats over 7 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='texas-a-m-aggies-over-8'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>Texas A&amp;M Aggies over 8 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M was one of the nation&#8217;s biggest underachievers in 2022 and still has question marks for this season but with coach Bobby Petrino in charge of play calling for head coach Jimbo Fisher, optimism reigns on the offense under quarterback Connor Weigman and wide receiver Evan Stewart. The Texas A&amp;M defense was young and highly talented last season and will improve with experience. If the offense is able to improve, expect to see the Aggies win at least eight games. </span></p>

<h3 id='alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Alabama Crimson Tide Under 10.5 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama will once again be a highly talented football team in 2023 but the quarterback position remains unsettled. Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.  </span></p>
<h3 id="boomdevs_9"><strong><br />
Sleeper: Tennessee Volunteers +1,500 to win SEC @<a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game. Quarterback Joe Milton takes the reins this season in Knoxville, and the Volunteers will have each of their top three running backs returning, including Jabari Small, Jaylen Wright, and Dylan Sampson, who combined to rush for 5.6 yards per carry with 29 touchdowns on the ground. Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Football Season kicks off Saturday August 26, and three Conference USA games are on the slate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the Conference USA action for Week 1 on Saturday August 26:</span></p>
<p><strong>UTEP at Jacksonville State at 5:30pm EST on CBSSN (<a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/8-26-2023/utep-vs-jacksonville-state-prediction-6531/">preview here)</a></strong></p>

<p>To bet on these games s<span style="font-weight: 400;">ign up for FanDuel </span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2436&amp;c=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b05.png" alt="⬅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference Conference USA will look a little different this season after nine of their members over the past two seasons due to realignment. This season, the conference welcomes two former FCS teams in Jacksonville State and Sam Houston State University. They also added two FBS independents in Liberty and New Mexico State, leaving only five holdovers from last season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the addition of the new schools, only a few teams in the conference have a legitimate chance to compete for the Conference USA title this season. So, we will look at those teams and predict how many wins they will have this upcoming season with the odds according to<a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2436&amp;c="> FanDuel.</a> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='liberty-+125-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_4" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty +125  to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flames finished the 2022 season with an 8-5 record, which was the second-best record for Independents. During the offseason, former head coach Hugh Freeze left to coach at Auburn and the team has only eight returning starters from last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the departures from last season, there is a lot of optimism about the upcoming season. They hired 2020 AL Coach of the Year, Jamey Chadwell, who had a 35-14 record at Coastal Carolina before taking the Liberty job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty wasn’t very good offensively last season, averaging 27.7 points per game. Their passing game was 88</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country and their ground game was 51</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their offensive line should be better than it was last season after adding a few experienced transfers, led by former West Virginia offensive lineman Jordan White. They are also bringing back their top two quarterbacks from last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They lost their leading rusher Dae Dae Hunter, who entered the transfer portal, but they added Wake Forest transfer Quinton Cooley and top recruit Vaughn Blue, so don’t expect to see a drop-off in their running game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flames were very good defensively last season, giving up points per game, which was 56</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. They led the country in tackles for loss and finished third in sacks. But, they only have four of their players coming back and they tried to fix the holes left through the transfer portal, so expect to see a drop-off on that end.</span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_5" ></h3>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-under-8-5-+134'  id="boomdevs_6" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection UNDER 8.5 (+134)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty’s win total for the season has been set at 8.5 at -164. The Flames won eight games in each of the past two seasons. Even though Chadwell had a lot of success at his last job, the Flames lost a lot of players in the offseason, so go with them to win less than 8.5 games this season.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hilltoppers finished the 2022 season with a 9-5 overall record and a 6-2 record in conference play, which was good enough for third place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky had the second-best offense in the conference last season, averaging 36.4 points per game, which was 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the nation. They had a potent passing attack that averaged more than 350 yards per game, which was the second-best in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost offensive coordinator Jake Dickert, who took the head coaching job at Washington State, don’t expect to see a drop in their offensive efficiency because new offensive coordinator Drew Hollingshead, his Mississippi State team had the 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-best passing offense in the country last season and the fourth in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hilltoppers also have quarterback Austin Reed, who completed 65 percent of his passes for 4,744 yards, 40 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions last season, and leading receiver Malachi Corley, who had 101 catches for 1,293 yards and 11 touchdowns last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky’s biggest weakness going into the season is on the defensive end, with only four starters from a unit that gave up 23.5 points per game last season coming back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensive end JaQues Evans, who had 106 tackles, nine sacks, and 14 tackles for loss, will lead their young defense. The linebacker corps have a year under their belts and are expected to be better than last season, and the team added six transfers that they hope will have an immediate impact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-8-5-+110'  id="boomdevs_8" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 8.5 (+110)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky’s win total for the season has been set at 8.5 at +110. The Hilltoppers won nine games in each of the past two seasons. Their offense will be just as potent as it was last season and they shouldn’t suffer much of a drop on the defensive end. With two of the top three C-USA teams from last season playing in another conference, the Hilltoppers will win more than 8.5 games this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='middle-tennessee-state-+650-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_9" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Tennessee State +650 to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Raiders finished the 2022 season with an 8-5 record and a 4-4 record in conference play, which was good for fourth place in the conference, and picked up a win in the Hawaii Bowl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Raiders averaged 29.5 points per game last season, which was 59</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. Their passing game was 36</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but their ground game was 114</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost their starting quarterback, Nicholas Vattiato played well in limited action, completing 65.2 percent of his passes for 293 yards and one interception. However, they lost their top three receivers, so don’t expect their passing game to be as potent as it was last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Peasant led the team in rushing last season with 774 yards and nine touchdowns. But, he will be sharing the backfield with untested backs, so expect more of the same from their ground game this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Blue Raiders gave up 28.1 points per game, which was 82</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. They have a good linebacker corps, but their defensive line didn’t get a lot of pressure on opposing quarterbacks and they gave up 304.7 passing yards per game last season, which was the most by a defense. But, with nine starters coming back, the unit should be better than it was last season.</span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_10" ></h3>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-6-5-105'  id="boomdevs_11" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 6.5 (-105)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Tennessee State’s win total for this season has been set at 6.5 at -105 odds. The Blue Raiders won at least seven games in six of their last eight seasons. Their offense likely won’t be as good as it was last season, but their defense should be improved. They have three tough road games against Alabama, Missouri, and Western Kentucky on their schedule, but the rest of the schedule isn’t very tough, so expect them to win at least seven games this season.</span></p>

<h3 id='the-dark-horse-new-mexico-state-+2-200-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_13" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dark Horse: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico State +2,200 to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference USA is a top-heavy conference, with Western Kentucky, Liberty, and Middle Tennessee State considered the best teams in the conference. But, the Aggies finished the 2022 season with a 7-6 record in Jerry Kill’s first year as head coach, after going 2-10 the previous season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aggies averaged 25.6 points per game last season, which was 83</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. Their passing game was 120</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while their ground game was 57</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have eight starters returning on offense, including dual-threat quarterback Diego Pavia, who completed 53.2 percent of his passes for 1,450 yards, 13 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran for 508 yards and six touchdowns. They also have their top two running backs and four of their top five receivers coming back, so expect their offense to be better than last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Aggies gave up 24.3 points per game, which was 52</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country, which was a drastic improvement from the previous season, when they had one of the worst defenses in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost two of their top tacklers from last season and their best defensive back, they have experienced players like Tyriece Thomas and Izaiah Reed returning, so they will be okay against the run. Their secondary will be the weak link this season, but don’t expect much of a drop-off from them defensively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-6-5-+134'  id="boomdevs_14" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 6.5 (+134)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico State’s win total for this season has been set at 6.5 at +134 odds. The Aggies lost their first four games last season and went 7-2 in their nine games. They will be better than they were offensively last season, but there will be a drop-off on defense. They have the second-easiest schedule, with a road trip to Auburn being their toughest test, so expect them to win more than 6.5 games this season.</span></p>

<p>by <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/2">David &#8220;The Dominator&#8221; Hess</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone following me over the years knows my team is the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, so it makes sense that I will be handling their preview this year. With six starters back on offense and eight on defense, plus the addition of QB Sam Hartman from Wake Forest, can the Irish get back in the National Title picture?  Well let’s dig in and see. </span></p>
<h2 id='caesars-sportsbook-promo-code-wawmetaget-bet-$50-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-for-the-notre-dame-vs-navy-game-this-saturday-you-can-grab-that-offer-here'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code WAWMETAGET &#8211; Bet $50, Get $250 in Bonus Bets for the Notre Dame vs Navy game this Saturday!

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marcus Freeman Era did not get off to a good start as he lost the Bowl game in 2021 and then followed that up by going 0-2 to start last year. Their low point over that stretch was a home loss to Marshall as 20.5 point favorites, but Notre Dame did rebound to 9-2 the rest of the way. That includes a 45-38 Bowl win over South Carolina, which gives them some momentum heading into this year. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1277" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1277" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1277" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_20984657_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /><p id="caption-attachment-1277" class="wp-caption-text">Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Marcus Freeman talks with an official during first half action. The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish took on the University of South Carolina Gamecocks in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl game in Jacksonville, Florida&#8217;s TIAA Bank Field Friday, December 30, 2022. The first half ended with South Carolina holding a 24 to 17 lead. [Bob Self/Florida Times-Union]<br />Jki 123022 Bs Gatorbowl 36</p></div><b>The Offense:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Last year, the Irish had six starters back and they averaged just 31.8 ppg, which was 42nd in the nation. Notre Dame’s issue was inconsistent play at the QB position, but they may have rectified that problem by signing Sam Hartman from Wase Forest. Hartman has five years of experience and he threw for 12,967 yards with 110 TDs and 41 INTs in 48 games for the Demon Deacons. He will be a huge upgrade over Drew Pyne and Tyler Buchner, who split time at the QB slot for Notre Dame last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Receiving Corps is a bit thin, especially with the loss of TE Michael Mayer, who was a 2nd round-draft choice of the Raiders. Still, there are some talented receivers in this group and they have a dynamite QB that will get them the ball. Last year, the Irish were 35th in rushing, after finishing 77th the year before. Notre Dame should improve on last year’s numbers as they have back Audric Estime (920 yards, 11 TDs) and Chris Tyree (444 yards, 3 TDs) plus have added Penn State transfer Devyn Ford (667 yards the last four years). Not only does Phil Steel have Notre Dame with the 10th-best RB Corp in the nation, but he also has them with the 15th-best Offensive line as well. Getting this ground game going will only make Hartman and the passing game that much more dangerous and I can see Notre Dame easily topping 35 ppg this year. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Defense:</strong> Before Marcus Freeman took over as head coach, he was the defensive coordinator for the Irish, but last year, Notre Dame did slip in this department. The Irish allowed 23 ppg last year, aver giving up no more than 19.7 ppg in their previous four years. Notre Dame allowed 329 ypg (22nd in the nation), which was actually a 31 ypg improvement over 2021, but still, the points allowed were worse. That was due to an inconsistent offense that put the defense in bad spots. We won’t see that this year with Hartman at QB and a dynamite ground attack. Notre Dame returns 8 starters, including their top four tacklers from last year and according to Phil Steele, they have the #`18 Defensive Line, #7 Linebacking Corps, and the #9 Secondary in the nation. Oh boy, this defense has a chance to be top ten in the nation. </span></p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Last year, the Irish had a solid defense, but the offense was inconsistent and that was the problem for them. Despite that, Notre Dame still had a 9-4 record overall, including a 9-2 finish. This year, they have QB Sam Hartman, a strong offensive line, and a powerful running game, which will all complement the defense nicely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/8-26-2023/navy-vs-notre-dame-prediction-4513/">Notre Dame begins with Navy</a> (Neutral Field), Tennessee State (Home), NC State (Away), and Central Michigan (Home), so they have a nice easy slate to give Hartman a chance to gel with his receiving corps. This is important as game five is at home against Ohio State. Notre Dame will also get USC at home later in the year, but they drop have a tough road game against Clemsom on November 4th. That game against Clemson could be the one that puts Notre Dame in the playoffs or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a loaded Irish team that will average 35+ ppg and allow less than 17 ppg and provided they don’t lose focus, as they did in the Marshall and Stanford games last year, Notre Dame has a bonafide shot at 11 regular season wins and a spot in the playoffs.      </span></p>
