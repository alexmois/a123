<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sign up in Kentucky  for FanDuel Promo Code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c="><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b05.png" alt="⬅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  for the opening weekend of College Football and get $100 off on the Sunday NFL Ticket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_3" ><strong>SEC Champion Prediction: LSU Tigers (+460) @ <a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As has been the case for several seasons, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is loaded with talented teams in both the East and West divisions. The defending National Champion Georgia Bulldogs (-110) will win the East Division. I then expect Georgia to face the LSU Tigers (+450) in the conference Championship game, with the Tigers prevailing.  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1313" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1313" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-medium wp-image-1313" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19372620_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19372620_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19372620_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1313" class="wp-caption-text">Nov 5, 2022; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA; LSU Tigers quarterback Jayden Daniels (5) is tackled by Alabama Crimson Tide defensive lineman DJ Dale (94) and linebacker Chris Braswell (41) during the second half at Tiger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LSU Quarterback Jayden Daniels will begin his second season under head coach Brian Kelly, and the offensive line should be much stronger than last season. The Tigers’ receiving corps, led by Malik Nabers (wide receiver) and Mason Taylor (tight end ), is one of the conference’s best. LSU has to play Alabama (+240) on the road, but the Tigers will prevail and win the division.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LSU defense gave up just 22.5 points per game last season and this season is even stronger upfront as Maason Smith is back following a knee injury that left him sidelined for most of the season last year. Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU&#8217;s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<h3 id='kentucky-wildcats-over-7'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>Kentucky Wildcats over 7 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='texas-a-m-aggies-over-8'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>Texas A&amp;M Aggies over 8 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M was one of the nation&#8217;s biggest underachievers in 2022 and still has question marks for this season but with coach Bobby Petrino in charge of play calling for head coach Jimbo Fisher, optimism reigns on the offense under quarterback Connor Weigman and wide receiver Evan Stewart. The Texas A&amp;M defense was young and highly talented last season and will improve with experience. If the offense is able to improve, expect to see the Aggies win at least eight games. </span></p>

<h3 id='alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Alabama Crimson Tide Under 10.5 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama will once again be a highly talented football team in 2023 but the quarterback position remains unsettled. Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.  </span></p>
<h3 id="boomdevs_9"><strong><br />
Sleeper: Tennessee Volunteers +1,500 to win SEC @<a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game. Quarterback Joe Milton takes the reins this season in Knoxville, and the Volunteers will have each of their top three running backs returning, including Jabari Small, Jaylen Wright, and Dylan Sampson, who combined to rush for 5.6 yards per carry with 29 touchdowns on the ground. Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.</span></p>
