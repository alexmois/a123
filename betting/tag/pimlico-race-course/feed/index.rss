<p>If you’re reading this article, it’s likely because you crushed our Kentucky Derby exacta pick of Mage and Two Phils that paid a hefty $330.44 for a $2 wager. Yes, that’s 150-1 on your money!</p>



<p>You’re welcome!</p>



<p>Who’s ready for round two of horse racing’s biggest time of the year, the Triple Crown races? We&#8217;re here to give you the lowdown once again on how to turn your bets into straight-up cash. Embrace the &#8220;bet small to win big&#8221; concept and make the most out of our free Preakness predictions (below).</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll guide you through the ins and outs of this wild ride, from basic betting to advanced strategies like exactas and trifectas to help you make informed choices.</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/how-to-bet-the-preakness-5-key-questions-answered-431/" data-type="post" data-id="431">How to Bet the 2023 Preakness: 5 Key Questions Answered</a></p>



<p>Ready to get to it? Here’s a brief breakdown of who we like and why. Below is the breakdown of exactly how to construct each ticket. Newbies welcome!</p>



<p><strong>#5 Red Route One </strong>is a horse we expected to be in the money at the Derby but was pulled late in the week. Now, this horse has a shot at redemption in the Preakness. Currently, at 10-1 odds, a win would yield a sizable payout. Red Route One is trained by one of the winningest trainers in the country Steve Asmussen and ridden by legendary jockey Joel Rosario. In four starts this year, Red Route One has one win, his latest race, the Bath House Row stakes at Oaklawn Park at 1 1/8, along with two second-place finishes. Rosario has won 39% of his mounts thus far on the season.</p>



<p>Next up I like <strong>#7 Blazing Sevens</strong>, currently projected at 6-1. Blazing Sevens is trained by Chad Brown, who has two Preakness wins in his career in 2017 and again last year in 2022. Blazing Sevens will be ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr. He has won the Belmont twice and finished second in the Preakness once. This year, Ortiz Jr. has finished in the money in 59% of his rides. Blazing Sevens has finished in the money in four of his six career starts on dirt, including two wins, and a 3rd in his most recent start in Keeneland, the 1 1/8 Bluegrass Stakes.</p>



<p>Lastly, we favor <strong>#1 National Treasure</strong>, who comes in at 4-1 currently. National Treasure is under the tutelage of trainer Tim Yakteen and ridden by jockey John R. Velazquez. Velazquez has been in the money in 45% of his mounts this year and has the experience to guide this horse to the winner’s circle. National Treasure has been in the money in four out of five career starts including one win.</p>



<p>While you can certainly return to the safe plays like <strong>#3 Mage</strong> and <strong>#8 First Mission</strong>, I like the pedigree and experience backing all three of the previously listed horses. I’ve included Mage as part of all my box plays as well. I do expect Mage to be a factor in the race and it certainly pays to have the winner of the first leg of the Triple Crown in your thoughts.</p>



<h2 id='here-s-a-breakdown-of-how-i-would-allocate-a-$200-bet-in-the-race-to-swing-for-the-fences'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how I would allocate a $200 bet in the race to swing for the fences.</h2>



<p>$1 Superfecta Box: Blazing Sevens/National Treasure/Red Route One/Mage/First Mission = $120<br>$1 Trifecta Box: Blazing Sevens/National Treasure/Red Route One/Mage/ First Mission =$60<br>$1 Exacta Box: Blazing Sevens/National Treasure/Red Route One/Mage/ First Mission =$20</p>



<p>If you prefer to wager only $100, simply reduce each amount by 50%, and adjust accordingly for other amounts.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are two racebooks offering generous sign-up bonuses, which you could use to potentially increase your winnings. I’ve outlined some strategies for leveraging those bonuses.</p>



<p><strong>Option #1</strong>, <strong>AmWager: </strong>Deposit up to $150 and AmWager will match it 100%. Let AmWager fund half your wagers! It&#8217;s the perfect way to maximize your Preakness winnings. <strong><a href="https://www.amwager.com/?amwaffid=ATSWins&amp;amwpromocode=MATCH150" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amwager.com/?amwaffid=ATSWins&amp;amwpromocode=MATCH150">Click here to sign up and AmWager will give you a 100% First Deposit Match Bonus, of up to $150.</a></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Preakness Stakes, as the second jewel in horse racing&#8217;s illustrious Triple Crown, offers a unique blend of challenges and opportunities for both seasoned bettors and casual fans. A thorough understanding of its history, trends, and peculiarities can provide a critical edge in making successful wagers. To assist you, we&#8217;ve addressed five key questions that could shape your betting strategy for this year&#8217;s race. From examining past winners&#8217; paths to debunking popular myths about the course, we&#8217;re here to guide you through the intricacies of betting the Preakness. Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id='1-how-do-kentucky-derby-winners-do-in-the-preakness'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >#1: How do Kentucky Derby winners do in the Preakness?</h3>



<p>In the new millennium, 8 Derby winners have clinched the Preakness title. Notably, this includes the trio of War Emblem, Funny Cide, and Smarty Jones, who all triumphed consecutively from 2002-2004. Despite this, the recent trend seems to favor the fresh contenders, colloquially known as &#8220;new shooters&#8221;. The last two Derby winners to win the Preakness went on to complete the prestigious Triple Crown.</p>



<p>This year, Mage will attempt to complete the Kentucky Derby/Preakness double with hopes of competing for the Triple Crown.</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/2023-preakness-picks-with-exacta-trifecta-and-superfecta-predictions-420/" data-type="post" data-id="420">See our 2023 Preakness picks: exactas, trifecta, and superfecta from the Expert who won the Kentucky Derby Exacta!</a></p>



<h3 id='2-how-many-preakness-winners-did-not-run-in-the-kentucky-derby'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >#2: How many Preakness winners did not run in the Kentucky Derby?</h3>



<p>In a somewhat recent trend, non-Derby runners have started to dominate the Preakness. For example, in the last 6 years, 4 Preakness winners did not participate in the Kentucky Derby. This includes the champions of the past three years. However, this trend only began to surface around 2017, with Rachel Alexandra&#8217;s 2009 victory standing as an outlier.</p>



<p>This year, all but one contender, Kentucky Derby winner Mage, will be new shooters lookinng to claim thier spot in the Preakness winner circle.</p>



<h3 id='3-what-is-the-optimal-running-style-of-past-preakness-winners'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" >#3: What is the optimal running style of past Preakness winners?</h3>



<p>Preakness victories aren&#8217;t typically claimed by runaway leaders. While there are a few exceptions like Justify in 2018, Oxbow in 2013, and Shackleford in 2011, a more strategic approach often seems to yield success. The &#8216;ideal&#8217; running style appears to involve staying near the front of the pack, ready to make a decisive move near the stretch. Big rallies from horses far behind have been a rarity in the Preakness.</p>



<p>This year&#8217;s likley horses that fit the ideal running style are 1 National Treasure (4-1) and 8 First Mission (5/2).</p>



<h3 id='4-fact-or-fiction-does-pimlico-really-have-8220-tight-turns-8221'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >#4: Fact or Fiction: Does Pimlico really have &#8220;Tight Turns?&#8221;</h3>



<p>A longstanding belief about Pimlico&#8217;s &#8220;tight turns&#8221; affecting the Preakness has been debunked. Extensive research by the Daily Racing Form revealed that Pimlico and Churchill Downs (where the Derby is held) have the exact same circumference. Pimlico is slightly narrower, resulting in less banking in the turns, but the difference is marginal and not significantly impactful.</p>



<h3 id='5-what-are-the-most-successful-post-positions-in-the-preakness'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >#5: What are the most successful post positions in the Preakness?</h3>



<p>The 6 position has proven to be the most successful among Preakness winners, boasting 17 victories, including the 2021 winner, Rombauer. This year, Perform at odds of 15-1 draws the 6 position in the Preakenss. Other notable positions are 4 and 7, each of which has recorded 13 wins.</p>



<p>The 4 this year is Coffeewithchris (20-1) and the 7 is Blazing Sevens (6-1).</p>



<h2 id='bonus-questions'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" >Bonus questions!</h2>



<p>Keep reading to find out the average payouts for the Preakness.</p>



<h3 id='what-is-the-average-win-payout-in-the-preakness'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" >What is the average win payout in the Preakness?</h3>



<p>Since 1990, placing a $2 win bet in the Preakness has yielded an average return of $10.90.</p>



<h3 id='what-is-the-average-exacta-payout-in-the-preakness'  id="boomdevs_8" class="wp-block-heading" >What is the average exacta payout in the Preakness?</h3>



<p>The average Exacta payout in the Preakness has also been lucrative. Since 1990, a $2 Exacta bet has returned an average of $99.87.</p>



<h3 id='what-is-the-average-trifecta-payout-in-the-preakness'  id="boomdevs_9" class="wp-block-heading" >What is the average trifecta payout in the Preakness?</h3>



<p>Since 1990, the average trifecta has been particularly rewarding, paying out a considerable $928.10</p>



<h3 id='for-the-first-time-in-triple-crown-history-8230'  id="boomdevs_10" class="wp-block-heading" >For the First time in Triple Crown History&#8230;</h3>



<p>For a dose of trivia, consider this: Since the establishment of the current Triple Crown schedule in 1969, this year marks the first instance where only a single horse from the Kentucky Derby, namely Mage, will be participating in the Preakness.</p>
