<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Will Texas Upset Alabama tonight?</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Longhorns at Alabama Crimson Tide</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Date: Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time: 7:00 PM EST </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds: Alabama -7 O/U 54.5</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert College Football Writer Michael Briggs states:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Longhorns may be relevant again but don&#8217;t expect another close game between these teams in Tuscaloosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alabama defense is going to give Texas a rude awakening. Sure, the Longhorns have star talent, but wait &#8217;til you see what the locked-in Bama defense does to them on Saturday. The Crimson Tide were almost robotic in their shutdown performance against Middle Tennessee and will look to expose Ewers and Texas as frauds for even entering the conversation of college football&#8217;s elite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On offense, Alabama will score enough to win and cover. It&#8217;s a disciplined team (zero turnovers and two penalties in week one) — but that&#8217;s hardly surprising given the accountability on the Bama roster. This is a professional program brimming with players with realistic NFL aspirations. They understand if they&#8217;re not accountable on every play, there&#8217;s a guy behind them ready and able to take their job. The Tide committed 15 penalties against Texas last season, something Saban has likely reminded his players about more than once this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milroe&#8217;s dual-threat ability will be a factor on Saturday, forcing the Longhorns to take some of their attention off the Crimson Tide&#8217;s other playmakers. That will prove deadly on several occasions, giving Bama the cushion it needs to comfortably cover the seven-point spread.</span></p>
<p><strong>Prediction: Alabama -7</strong></p>
<div></div>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FanDuel Promo Code offer is truly one of the best available among all sportsbooks. What makes FanDuel’s offer great is it is easy to understand, and it is a benefit to everyone who receives it. With FanDuel, new users will receive <a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_28100b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=28100&amp;adid=2436&amp;c=">$200 in Bonus Bets + $100 off on NFL Sunday Ticket</a>, regardless of if their first qualifying bet wins or loses on the first bet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I personally love how <a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_28100b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=28100&amp;adid=2436&amp;c=">FanDuel</a> overall has been to easy to work with. Their customer service is excellent, and they also offer a great variety of payout options. Depositing and making withdrawals are also easy.</span></p>
<p>Want a second opinion to tonight&#8217;s Texas vs Alabama game?</p>
<p><b>StatSalt.com Expert College Football Writer Craig Forde states:</b></p>
<div class="analysis">
<p>Nothing like a massive game this early in the season, the results of which could set the tone for the rest of the pack seeking CFP bids. The Longhorns have stated this week that they will be looking to test Milroe’s arm, after holding Rice to just 149 passing yards and two interceptions. The Tide QB threw the ball just 18 times last week and though the Tide’s starting QB was able to complete 71% of those passes, it was against a defensive backfield that pales in comparison to what the Longhorns are going to throw at him. Texas’ defense is also athletic enough to chase him down should Milroe free himself of the pocket. Last season’s meeting was a 20-19 classic that went the way of Alabama. I don’t know if Texas pulls it off in Tuscaloosa, but I do think they will keep things close once again and put themselves in a position for a big W.</p>
<p>Take Texas getting the points.</p>
</div>
<div class="pick"><strong>Prediction: Texas +7</strong></div>

<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-5-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_3" >Andrew Abbott Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</h3>
<p>I will be hammering Abbott’s strikeout prop in this one, as he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in five straight games and the Cardinals have continued to struggle on the road this season. They haven’t been extremely hot at the plate over their last three games either. They averaged 9.67 Ks per game in their last 3, as I see them struggling again in this one. Abbott has been solid all season and he’s going to show up in this one.</p>
<p>Take him to record Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</p>

<p>This is a MASSIVE game for the Rays and I expect Bradley to pitch deep into this game. He has also recorded at least 15 outs in four of his last five starts. He also picked up a win in his last start, as I see him picking up steam and starting to roll. It isn’t like Seattle has been this offensive powerhouse this season either. They only have the 19th highest team batting average, as I believe this game will be low scoring and tight.</p>
<p>Bradley will hang around and pitch long enough to record more than 14.5 Outs.</p>
<h3 id='yusei-kikuchi-over-15-5-outs-recorded-125'  id="boomdevs_6" >Yusei Kikuchi Over 15.5 Outs Recorded (-125)</h3>
<p>I love this spot for Kikuchi, as I have been backing him a lot lately. He is 9-5 on the season and he only has a 3.63 ERA, as this Royals batting lineup doesn’t stand a chance. They have cooled down over the last two weeks and they still have one of the worst records in baseball. Yusei has also pitched for at least six innings in four of his last six starts. He’s been a reliable starter for the Blue Jays for the last month and a half and I expect him to dominate a poor Kansas City team in this one.</p>
<p>Take Kikuchi to record more than 15.5 Outs (-125).</p>
<h3 id='parlay-odds-+359'  id="boomdevs_7" >Parlay Odds: +359</h3>
<p>Yes, these picks might look a little bit safer today, but I promise you this is a great strategy when<br />
setting up your parlays. If you can find three “Favorites” that you believe have a serious<br />
advantage, then parlay them together, and let it rip! That’s exactly what I am doing today and I expect to CASH IN BIG! So, strap in tight and get ready to ride! Let’s have a FANTASTIC<br />
Friday!</p>

<li>Date: Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023</li>
<li>Time: Noon PM EST</li>
<li>Odds: Notre Dame -7.5 O/U 50.5</li>
<li><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/9-9-2023/notre-dame-vs-nc-state-prediction-5872/">David &#8220;The Dominator&#8221; Hess</a> writes:</li>
</ul>
<p>The Irish had a great defense last year, but an inconsistent offense kept them from competing for a national Title. Now they have a powerful ground game and one of the best QBs in the nation in Sam Hartman, so you can bet that the Irish will not take their foot off the gas here. They know that they have a shot at the playoffs and can&#8217;t afford to look past anyone. Notre Dame is off an easy win against Tennessee State, and they have just Central Michigan on deck, so there is no reason for them not to be focused in this one. Notre Dame has strong edges on both sides of the ball, and they have a massive edge at QB. The Defense will shut Armstrong down while the offense puts up enough to get a solid cover in this one.</p>

<p>The Jayhawks return the most experience on offense in the country this season. Even with Daniels out in week one, the team still produced over 500 yards of offense. Daniels may be a game-time decision although Leipold&#8217;s comments after the game suggest that Daniels didn&#8217;t play in the opener more due to a lack of reps than injury. With another week under his belt, Daniels may be under center on Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction: Kansas -2.</strong></p>

<div class="analysis">
<p>The Nebraska defense looked great against Minnesota, but the Golden Gophers&#8217; passing game pales in comparison to Colorado&#8217;s aerial attack. At home in Coach Prime&#8217;s first game, the Buffaloes won&#8217;t miss a beat offensively.</p>
<p>I expect Colorado to play better defensively in week two, too. Sims was turnover-prone and too quick to desert the pocket against Minnesota — that won&#8217;t work as well against the athletes on the Colorado defense. They will make the Nebraska QB look too one-dimensional on Saturday, forcing him into picks when he&#8217;s pressing for conversions.</p>
<p>Once the Buffs take a commanding lead, they won&#8217;t relent. I&#8217;m very confident they will cover the spread, even with a sample size of one game.</p>

<p><strong>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert NFL Football Writer Chris King states:</strong></p>
<div class="analysis">
<p>&#8220;Detroit was hot in the second half of last season but it will be a challenge for the Lions to go on the road in a hostile environment like Arrowhead to earn a win. The Lions have some holes that they hope will be patched up here but the fact remains that their secondary has a lot of questions at this point. Sure, this isn’t the Chiefs team of previous years where guys like Tyreek Hill were running free but they still have Patrick Mahomes. Plus, Andy Reid knows how to get the most out of the pieces he has to work with and that should be enough to help push the Chiefs to a home win in the opener.&#8221;</p>

<div><strong>StatSalt.com Writer Craig Forde states: </strong></div>
<div>
<div class="analysis">
<p>This is a game where I fully expect the ball to be flying from the jump. Two of the better gunslingers in the league going head-to-head to kick off the entire season and you can bet that they’ll want to put their arms on full display here. They’ll both also benefit from some thin defensive backfields to throw at. The defenses will need to be in the faces of the quarterbacks if they want to stop the pass, but both are also agile and capable of scrambling out of the pocket. The last time they met they combined to score 64 points. I expect something close to that again.</p>
<p>Take the over.</p>

<h3 id='sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_3" ><strong>SEC Champion Prediction: LSU Tigers (+460) @ <a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As has been the case for several seasons, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is loaded with talented teams in both the East and West divisions. The defending National Champion Georgia Bulldogs (-110) will win the East Division. I then expect Georgia to face the LSU Tigers (+450) in the conference Championship game, with the Tigers prevailing.  </span></p>

Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LSU Quarterback Jayden Daniels will begin his second season under head coach Brian Kelly, and the offensive line should be much stronger than last season. The Tigers’ receiving corps, led by Malik Nabers (wide receiver) and Mason Taylor (tight end ), is one of the conference’s best. LSU has to play Alabama (+240) on the road, but the Tigers will prevail and win the division.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LSU defense gave up just 22.5 points per game last season and this season is even stronger upfront as Maason Smith is back following a knee injury that left him sidelined for most of the season last year. Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU&#8217;s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<h3 id='kentucky-wildcats-over-7'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>Kentucky Wildcats over 7 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility. </span></p>

<h3 id='texas-a-m-aggies-over-8'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>Texas A&amp;M Aggies over 8 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M was one of the nation&#8217;s biggest underachievers in 2022 and still has question marks for this season but with coach Bobby Petrino in charge of play calling for head coach Jimbo Fisher, optimism reigns on the offense under quarterback Connor Weigman and wide receiver Evan Stewart. The Texas A&amp;M defense was young and highly talented last season and will improve with experience. If the offense is able to improve, expect to see the Aggies win at least eight games. </span></p>

<h3 id='alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Alabama Crimson Tide Under 10.5 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama will once again be a highly talented football team in 2023 but the quarterback position remains unsettled. Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.  </span></p>

Sleeper: Tennessee Volunteers +1,500 to win SEC @<a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game. Quarterback Joe Milton takes the reins this season in Knoxville, and the Volunteers will have each of their top three running backs returning, including Jabari Small, Jaylen Wright, and Dylan Sampson, who combined to rush for 5.6 yards per carry with 29 touchdowns on the ground. Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference Conference USA will look a little different this season after nine of their members over the past two seasons due to realignment. This season, the conference welcomes two former FCS teams in Jacksonville State and Sam Houston State University. They also added two FBS independents in Liberty and New Mexico State, leaving only five holdovers from last season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the addition of the new schools, only a few teams in the conference have a legitimate chance to compete for the Conference USA title this season. So, we will look at those teams and predict how many wins they will have this upcoming season with the odds according to<a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2436&amp;c="> FanDuel.</a> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='liberty-+125-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_4" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty +125  to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flames finished the 2022 season with an 8-5 record, which was the second-best record for Independents. During the offseason, former head coach Hugh Freeze left to coach at Auburn and the team has only eight returning starters from last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the departures from last season, there is a lot of optimism about the upcoming season. They hired 2020 AL Coach of the Year, Jamey Chadwell, who had a 35-14 record at Coastal Carolina before taking the Liberty job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty wasn’t very good offensively last season, averaging 27.7 points per game. Their passing game was 88</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country and their ground game was 51</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their offensive line should be better than it was last season after adding a few experienced transfers, led by former West Virginia offensive lineman Jordan White. They are also bringing back their top two quarterbacks from last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They lost their leading rusher Dae Dae Hunter, who entered the transfer portal, but they added Wake Forest transfer Quinton Cooley and top recruit Vaughn Blue, so don’t expect to see a drop-off in their running game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flames were very good defensively last season, giving up points per game, which was 56</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. They led the country in tackles for loss and finished third in sacks. But, they only have four of their players coming back and they tried to fix the holes left through the transfer portal, so expect to see a drop-off on that end.</span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_5" ></h3>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-under-8-5-+134'  id="boomdevs_6" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection UNDER 8.5 (+134)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty’s win total for the season has been set at 8.5 at -164. The Flames won eight games in each of the past two seasons. Even though Chadwell had a lot of success at his last job, the Flames lost a lot of players in the offseason, so go with them to win less than 8.5 games this season.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hilltoppers finished the 2022 season with a 9-5 overall record and a 6-2 record in conference play, which was good enough for third place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky had the second-best offense in the conference last season, averaging 36.4 points per game, which was 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the nation. They had a potent passing attack that averaged more than 350 yards per game, which was the second-best in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost offensive coordinator Jake Dickert, who took the head coaching job at Washington State, don’t expect to see a drop in their offensive efficiency because new offensive coordinator Drew Hollingshead, his Mississippi State team had the 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-best passing offense in the country last season and the fourth in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hilltoppers also have quarterback Austin Reed, who completed 65 percent of his passes for 4,744 yards, 40 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions last season, and leading receiver Malachi Corley, who had 101 catches for 1,293 yards and 11 touchdowns last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky’s biggest weakness going into the season is on the defensive end, with only four starters from a unit that gave up 23.5 points per game last season coming back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensive end JaQues Evans, who had 106 tackles, nine sacks, and 14 tackles for loss, will lead their young defense. The linebacker corps have a year under their belts and are expected to be better than last season, and the team added six transfers that they hope will have an immediate impact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-8-5-+110'  id="boomdevs_8" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 8.5 (+110)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky’s win total for the season has been set at 8.5 at +110. The Hilltoppers won nine games in each of the past two seasons. Their offense will be just as potent as it was last season and they shouldn’t suffer much of a drop on the defensive end. With two of the top three C-USA teams from last season playing in another conference, the Hilltoppers will win more than 8.5 games this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='middle-tennessee-state-+650-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_9" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Tennessee State +650 to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Raiders finished the 2022 season with an 8-5 record and a 4-4 record in conference play, which was good for fourth place in the conference, and picked up a win in the Hawaii Bowl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Raiders averaged 29.5 points per game last season, which was 59</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. Their passing game was 36</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but their ground game was 114</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost their starting quarterback, Nicholas Vattiato played well in limited action, completing 65.2 percent of his passes for 293 yards and one interception. However, they lost their top three receivers, so don’t expect their passing game to be as potent as it was last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Peasant led the team in rushing last season with 774 yards and nine touchdowns. But, he will be sharing the backfield with untested backs, so expect more of the same from their ground game this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Blue Raiders gave up 28.1 points per game, which was 82</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. They have a good linebacker corps, but their defensive line didn’t get a lot of pressure on opposing quarterbacks and they gave up 304.7 passing yards per game last season, which was the most by a defense. But, with nine starters coming back, the unit should be better than it was last season.</span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_10" ></h3>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-6-5-105'  id="boomdevs_11" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 6.5 (-105)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Tennessee State’s win total for this season has been set at 6.5 at -105 odds. The Blue Raiders won at least seven games in six of their last eight seasons. Their offense likely won’t be as good as it was last season, but their defense should be improved. They have three tough road games against Alabama, Missouri, and Western Kentucky on their schedule, but the rest of the schedule isn’t very tough, so expect them to win at least seven games this season.</span></p>

<h3 id='the-dark-horse-new-mexico-state-+2-200-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_13" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dark Horse: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico State +2,200 to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference USA is a top-heavy conference, with Western Kentucky, Liberty, and Middle Tennessee State considered the best teams in the conference. But, the Aggies finished the 2022 season with a 7-6 record in Jerry Kill’s first year as head coach, after going 2-10 the previous season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aggies averaged 25.6 points per game last season, which was 83</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. Their passing game was 120</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while their ground game was 57</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have eight starters returning on offense, including dual-threat quarterback Diego Pavia, who completed 53.2 percent of his passes for 1,450 yards, 13 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran for 508 yards and six touchdowns. They also have their top two running backs and four of their top five receivers coming back, so expect their offense to be better than last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Aggies gave up 24.3 points per game, which was 52</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country, which was a drastic improvement from the previous season, when they had one of the worst defenses in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost two of their top tacklers from last season and their best defensive back, they have experienced players like Tyriece Thomas and Izaiah Reed returning, so they will be okay against the run. Their secondary will be the weak link this season, but don’t expect much of a drop-off from them defensively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-6-5-+134'  id="boomdevs_14" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 6.5 (+134)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico State’s win total for this season has been set at 6.5 at +134 odds. The Aggies lost their first four games last season and went 7-2 in their nine games. They will be better than they were offensively last season, but there will be a drop-off on defense. They have the second-easiest schedule, with a road trip to Auburn being their toughest test, so expect them to win more than 6.5 games this season.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id='friday-august-25-best-mlb-player-props-for-parlay'  id="boomdevs_1" >Friday August 25 Best MLB Player Props for Parlay</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday! <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here and I am back again with another MLB Player Prop Parlay! The weekend is finally here and I am looking to pay for all of your drinks tonight. But, first we are going to look at three pitchers that have great matchups and they’ve been putting up STELLAR numbers all season long. So, ride with me today! Hop on these three MLB Player Props and get ready to land back in the GREEN!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2 id='bet-$50-and-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-when-you-sign-up-with-caesar-sportsbook-and-use-promo-code-wawmetaget'  id="boomdevs_2" >Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets <span style="font-weight: 400;">when you sign up with <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesar Sportsbook</a> and USE Promo Code: WAWMETAGET </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>21+ Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" ></h3>
<h3 id="boomdevs_4"><b>Tanner Bibee Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for Bibee on the road, as he is 9-3 on the season with a 3.01 ERA. He has consistently got the job done for his team all season long and he pitched great against this same Blue Jays team just three starts back. He pitched for seven innings and only allowed two earned runs, as I see him putting up similar numbers in this game. He will stay out of trouble for the majority of the game, as I expect him to pitch at least six innings. Toronto hasn’t been going crazy at the plate and I don’t see them lighting up Bibee early. Take him to record more than 17.5 Outs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dylan-cease-over-17-5-outs-recorded-145'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Dylan Cease Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-145)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also really like this spot at home for Dylan Cease. The White Sox fell to the A’s yesterday and they are going to be highly motivated to bounce back in this game. Cease is arguably their best pitcher and he should be ready to bounce back in this game. He struggled against the Rockies in his last start, but now he is facing one of the worst offenses in the league. Oakland is averaging the least amount of runs per game and they are only 3-7 in their last 10. They will struggle in this game and Cease will pitch consistently throughout. Take Dylan Cease to record more than 17.5 Outs with the second pick of our parlay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='spencer-strider-over-8-5-strikeouts-135'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Spencer Strider Over 8.5 Strikeouts (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for the Braves and Strider. The Giants have continued to strike out all season and they haven’t overly impressed me as of late. They are 3-7 in their last 10 games played and they are averaging the fourth most strikeouts per game in the MLB. They are averaging 9.42 strikeouts per game, as this is a perfect spot for Strider at home. He actually faced this same exact Giants team in his last start, as well. In that game, he recorded 10 strikeouts, pitched for 7 innings, and only allowed 1 hit. He has the Giants number and I expect him to stay hot in this game. Take Spencer Strider to record more than 8.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, I only have one simple message. Let’s win. We’ve been knocking on the door the last two weeks and I love these plays today.

The weekend is finally here and this parlay is going to pay for your tab tonight! Lock in and let’s have a GREAT Friday!</span></p>
