<p><span data-contrast="none">In the world of sports betting, building a bankroll is something that every bettor should strive for. A bankroll is money that you have available to bet with. This money should be separate from the funds you use for daily and monthly living expenses and should not be depended on to pay rent, a mortgage, a car note, tuition, or food for your family. Setting aside a bankroll for sports betting and growing that bankroll without constantly adding money out of your personal funds is vital for long-term success.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Each sportsbook has a unique set of bonuses.

While some sportsbooks may be willing to take up to a $50,000 wager for a New Giants vs. Dallas Cowboys Monday Night Football Game, another sportsbook may limit it to just a $1,000 bet for that same game. When it comes to a college basketball game between Houston Christian and Lamar, you may be limited to just a $200 bet, and sometimes even less if you consistently win. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">It is not unheard of for some bettors to be limited to only $25 bets on player props, so if you want to bet on Nikola Jokic to record over nine assists in an NBA game, you may find that the options and limits are much lower than what you run into when simply betting on a point spread or over/under. You can get around these low limits and find the best odds by having accounts with numerous books. By spreading your bets around between books, you can place more wagers and are less likely to be limited, especially if you are a big-money player who has been able to win consistently over time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>by <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/2">David &#8220;The Dominator&#8221; Hess</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone following me over the years knows my team is the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, so it makes sense that I will be handling their preview this year. With six starters back on offense and eight on defense, plus the addition of QB Sam Hartman from Wake Forest, can the Irish get back in the National Title picture?  Well let’s dig in and see. </span></p>
<h2 id='caesars-sportsbook-promo-code-wawmetaget-bet-$50-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-for-the-notre-dame-vs-navy-game-this-saturday-you-can-grab-that-offer-here'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code WAWMETAGET &#8211; Bet $50, Get $250 in Bonus Bets for the Notre Dame vs Navy game this Saturday! You can grab that offer <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">here</a>!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marcus Freeman Era did not get off to a good start as he lost the Bowl game in 2021 and then followed that up by going 0-2 to start last year. Their low point over that stretch was a home loss to Marshall as 20.5 point favorites, but Notre Dame did rebound to 9-2 the rest of the way. That includes a 45-38 Bowl win over South Carolina, which gives them some momentum heading into this year. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1277" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1277" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-medium wp-image-1277" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_20984657_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /><p id="caption-attachment-1277" class="wp-caption-text">Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Marcus Freeman talks with an official during first half action. The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish took on the University of South Carolina Gamecocks in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl game in Jacksonville, Florida&#8217;s TIAA Bank Field Friday, December 30, 2022. The first half ended with South Carolina holding a 24 to 17 lead. [Bob Self/Florida Times-Union]<br />Jki 123022 Bs Gatorbowl 36</p></div><b>The Offense:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Last year, the Irish had six starters back and they averaged just 31.8 ppg, which was 42nd in the nation. Notre Dame’s issue was inconsistent play at the QB position, but they may have rectified that problem by signing Sam Hartman from Wase Forest. Hartman has five years of experience and he threw for 12,967 yards with 110 TDs and 41 INTs in 48 games for the Demon Deacons. He will be a huge upgrade over Drew Pyne and Tyler Buchner, who split time at the QB slot for Notre Dame last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Receiving Corps is a bit thin, especially with the loss of TE Michael Mayer, who was a 2nd round-draft choice of the Raiders. Still, there are some talented receivers in this group and they have a dynamite QB that will get them the ball. Last year, the Irish were 35th in rushing, after finishing 77th the year before. Notre Dame should improve on last year’s numbers as they have back Audric Estime (920 yards, 11 TDs) and Chris Tyree (444 yards, 3 TDs) plus have added Penn State transfer Devyn Ford (667 yards the last four years). Not only does Phil Steel have Notre Dame with the 10th-best RB Corp in the nation, but he also has them with the 15th-best Offensive line as well. Getting this ground game going will only make Hartman and the passing game that much more dangerous and I can see Notre Dame easily topping 35 ppg this year. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Defense:</strong> Before Marcus Freeman took over as head coach, he was the defensive coordinator for the Irish, but last year, Notre Dame did slip in this department. The Irish allowed 23 ppg last year, aver giving up no more than 19.7 ppg in their previous four years. Notre Dame allowed 329 ypg (22nd in the nation), which was actually a 31 ypg improvement over 2021, but still, the points allowed were worse. That was due to an inconsistent offense that put the defense in bad spots. We won’t see that this year with Hartman at QB and a dynamite ground attack. Notre Dame returns 8 starters, including their top four tacklers from last year and according to Phil Steele, they have the #`18 Defensive Line, #7 Linebacking Corps, and the #9 Secondary in the nation. Oh boy, this defense has a chance to be top ten in the nation. </span></p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Last year, the Irish had a solid defense, but the offense was inconsistent and that was the problem for them. Despite that, Notre Dame still had a 9-4 record overall, including a 9-2 finish. This year, they have QB Sam Hartman, a strong offensive line, and a powerful running game, which will all complement the defense nicely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/8-26-2023/navy-vs-notre-dame-prediction-4513/">Notre Dame begins with Navy</a> (Neutral Field), Tennessee State (Home), NC State (Away), and Central Michigan (Home), so they have a nice easy slate to give Hartman a chance to gel with his receiving corps. This is important as game five is at home against Ohio State. Notre Dame will also get USC at home later in the year, but they drop have a tough road game against Clemsom on November 4th. That game against Clemson could be the one that puts Notre Dame in the playoffs or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a loaded Irish team that will average 35+ ppg and allow less than 17 ppg and provided they don’t lose focus, as they did in the Marshall and Stanford games last year, Notre Dame has a bonafide shot at 11 regular season wins and a spot in the playoffs.      </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday! <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here and I am back again with another MLB Player Prop Parlay! The weekend is finally here and I am looking to pay for all of your drinks tonight. But, first we are going to look at three pitchers that have great matchups and they’ve been putting up STELLAR numbers all season long. So, ride with me today! Hop on these three MLB Player Props and get ready to land back in the GREEN!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2 id='bet-$50-and-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-when-you-sign-up-with-caesar-sportsbook-and-use-promo-code-wawmetaget'  id="boomdevs_2" >Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets <span style="font-weight: 400;">when you sign up with <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesar Sportsbook</a> and USE Promo Code: WAWMETAGET </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>21+ Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" ></h3>
<h3 id="boomdevs_4"><b>Tanner Bibee Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for Bibee on the road, as he is 9-3 on the season with a 3.01 ERA. He has consistently got the job done for his team all season long and he pitched great against this same Blue Jays team just three starts back. He pitched for seven innings and only allowed two earned runs, as I see him putting up similar numbers in this game. He will stay out of trouble for the majority of the game, as I expect him to pitch at least six innings. Toronto hasn’t been going crazy at the plate and I don’t see them lighting up Bibee early. Take him to record more than 17.5 Outs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dylan-cease-over-17-5-outs-recorded-145'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Dylan Cease Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-145)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also really like this spot at home for Dylan Cease. The White Sox fell to the A’s yesterday and they are going to be highly motivated to bounce back in this game. Cease is arguably their best pitcher and he should be ready to bounce back in this game. He struggled against the Rockies in his last start, but now he is facing one of the worst offenses in the league. Oakland is averaging the least amount of runs per game and they are only 3-7 in their last 10. They will struggle in this game and Cease will pitch consistently throughout. Take Dylan Cease to record more than 17.5 Outs with the second pick of our parlay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='spencer-strider-over-8-5-strikeouts-135'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Spencer Strider Over 8.5 Strikeouts (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for the Braves and Strider. The Giants have continued to strike out all season and they haven’t overly impressed me as of late. They are 3-7 in their last 10 games played and they are averaging the fourth most strikeouts per game in the MLB. They are averaging 9.42 strikeouts per game, as this is a perfect spot for Strider at home. He actually faced this same exact Giants team in his last start, as well. In that game, he recorded 10 strikeouts, pitched for 7 innings, and only allowed 1 hit. He has the Giants number and I expect him to stay hot in this game. Take Spencer Strider to record more than 8.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>

<p>by <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/6">David Delano</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1215" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19709996_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19709996_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19709996_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lions, and Vikings, and Bears..oh my! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFC North should be highly competitive this season. Last season, each of the four teams in the division finished in the bottom five in the NFL in yards per play allowed defensively. With Aaron Rodgers now in New York, the Lions are favored to win their first division title since 1993.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are my OVER/UNDER win total betting predictions for the NFC North with odds provided by <a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077">Caesars Sportsbook</a>:</span></p>
<h3 id='4th-green-bay-packers-under-7-5-+120'  id="boomdevs_2" ><b>4TH: Green Bay Packers UNDER 7.5 (+120)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predicted Record 7-10</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Packers have a demanding schedule this season. Amongst the most significant challenges are road games against the Falcons, Broncos, Steelers, and Giants and home games against the Chargers and Chiefs. It will be challenging for the Packers to win more than one of those games. Whether or not Jordan Love will have this offense ready to keep up with his counterparts in the North is a big question, and considering that this team only went 8-9 with Aaron Rodgers last season, the under is the way to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id='why-go-halfway-when-you-can-go-full-caesar-snag-up-to-$1-250-in-bet-credit-if-your-first-bet-doesn-t-win'  id="boomdevs_3" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why go halfway when you can go <a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077">FULL CAESAR?</a> Snag up to $1,250 in bet credit if your first bet doesn&#8217;t win.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer:</span> <b>21+. Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id='3rd-minnesota-vikings-under-8-5-+105'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>3RD: Minnesota Vikings UNDER 8.5 (+105)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predicted Record 8-9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vikings have a challenging early schedule, playing four of their first seven games against the Eagles, Chargers, Chiefs, and 49ers. Road games at Atlanta and Denver will also be tough later on. Minnesota&#8217;s last four games on the schedule include a trip to Cincinnati and two games against the Lions. Almost everything went right for the Vikings last season, but I see regression in 2023. The under is the play here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2nd-chicago-bears-over-7-5-140'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>2ND: Chicago Bears OVER 7.5 (-140)</b></h3>
<p>Predicted record: 9-8</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bears went 3-14 last season and ended the season on a 10-game losing streak. Despite their poor record, they went 1-7 in games decided by seven points or less. This group will take a step forward in 2023. If they can win three divisional games, they’ll be in good shape to reach eight wins. Their schedule includes home games against the Raiders, Panthers, Cardinals, and Falcons and early season road games against the Buccaneers and Commanders. The Bears could be a sleeper to win the division, but there is still substantial room for improvement. Chicago&#8217;s defensive pass rush was dead last in the NFL in sacks last season which had a lot to do with the horrendous record. On the offensive side of the ball, the line was upgraded in the offseason, and with Justin Fields expected to take another step forward, I like the Bears to get to eight wins or more.</span></p>
<h3 id='1st-detroit-lions-under-9-5-+105'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>1ST: Detroit Lions UNDER 9.5 (+105)</b></h3>
<p>Predicted record: 9-8</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lions were a feel-good story last season, winning six games as an underdog and barely missing the playoffs. Although the defense should be better, I&#8217;m not ready to pencil the offense in as one of the top four in the NFL again. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the Lions have yet to win more than nine games since 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t see the Lions cruising through the NFC North and outside the division, and this group will have a hard time catching teams by surprise. The schedule has brutal matchups, including road games against the Chiefs, Ravens, Chargers, Saints, and Cowboys. I see the Lions winning eight or nine games in 2023, but not 10 or more.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1216" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19562391_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></p>
<h3 id='division-winner-detroit-lions-+120'  id="boomdevs_7" ><b>Division Winner: Detroit Lions +120</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I took the Lions to fall short of 9.5 wins, they are the best bet to win the North. Although the Lions won’t catch teams by surprise this season, the defense should be better, and they still have a higher floor than any other team in the division.</span></p>
<h3 id='if-you-are-looking-to-build-your-nfl-ncaa-football-or-mlb-bankroll-with-david-delano-or-any-of-our-other-handicappers-this-season-it-s-simple'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>If you are looking to build your NFL, NCAA Football, or MLB bankroll with David Delano or any of our other handicappers this season, it’s simple.</b></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id='nfc-east-predictions'  id="boomdevs_1" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFC East Predictions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Paul Biagioli</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC East last season with a 14-3 regular season on their way to a Super Bowl appearance. The NFC East was intensely competitive, as it was the only division to not have a team with a losing record last season. The Eagles, Cowboys and Giants all made the playoffs. Will the division have similar success this season? Check below for my predictions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='philadelphia-eagles-under-11-5-wins-115'  id="boomdevs_2" ><strong>Philadelphia Eagles: Under 11.5 wins (-115)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eagles caught the league by surprise last season, as Jalen Hurts helped to carry his team to the Super Bowl. They did not win the Super Bowl, but there will be a hangover in Philadelphia, as this team will not come close to winning 14 games again. They are playing a first-place schedule, with non-divisional games against the Chiefs, 49ers, Bills and Jets. The league has now had an entire off-season to learn how to stop their short yardage rugby scrum play, and its efficiency will start to dwindle. Hurts upped his completion percentage, yards, passing and rushing touchdowns and decreased his interceptions from the previous season. This type of growth will not happen again and the Eagles will take a small step back this season. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dallas-cowboys-over-10-5-wins-+115'  id="boomdevs_3" ><strong>Dallas Cowboys: Over 10.5 wins (+115)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dallas currently has the third best odds to win the conference, grabbing plus money for them to reach 11 wins is the smart play. Dak Prescott has missed significant time in two of the past three years due to injury, if he stays healthy Dallas has plenty of weapons to be a top-tier offense. Tony Pollard will finally be given to opportunity to be the lead back in Dallas, even though most insiders knew he was better than Ezekial Elliott over the past two seasons. Ceedee Lamb and Michael Gallup will mature and grow with a year of continuity, and the addition of Brandin Cooks provides another quick receiver for Prescott to dump it off to. Micah Parsons is in his prime and may be the best defensive player in the league. The Cowboys have the Giants, Cardinals and Patriots in three of their first four games, so they should easily start 3-1 on the way to hitting this season over. </span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_4" ></h3>
<h3 id='new-york-giants-over-7-5-wins-+100'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>New York Giants: Over 7.5 wins (+100)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the offseason news was about Saquon Barkley, his contract, and the disrespect shown to the running back position. The overload of negative press paints the picture of a disappointing season to come, but I believe the value is on the over. Barkley got his contract, he is going to play. Daniel Jones does not need to be an elite QB for this team to get wins. Brian Daboll proved he can design an offense that doesn’t ask too much of Jones while still producing points. Jones finished as a top 10 QB in fantasy scoring due to his running ability, and the Giants added Cole Beasley and Darren Waller as two short-yardage weapons, the Giants will be able to move the chains. Take their over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='washington-commanders-under-6-5-wins-120'  id="boomdevs_6" ><strong>Washington Commanders: Under 6.5 wins (-120)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commanders used up all their luck last season. They had the best record out of any team who finished last in their division. This will not happen again, except for the part about finishing last in their division. Sam Howell only threw 19 passes last season, but is now expected to lead this offense with a brand new offensive coordinator. There have already been rumblings that the players are not getting along with OC Eric Bieniemy due to his intense coaching style. Chase Young has not been able to prove he is still an elite pass rusher after tearing his ACL two years ago. This division is too tough, and I do not trust Sam Howell to go out and win many one-score games. Washington will be in the basement of the division, with less than six wins. </span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_7" ></h3>
<h3 id='division-winner-dallas-cowboys-+190'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Division Winner: Dallas Cowboys (+190)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great value here for a strong roster. In what is likely a two-team race, I’ll give the edge to the Cowboys. They welcome in a new offensive coordinator in Brian Schottenheimer, who has already received praise from Dak Prescott. Micah Parsons leads a strong defensive unit with Trevon Diggs, Demarcus Lawrence, and Stephon Gilmore. Zach Martin and Tyron Smith anchor a strong offensive line that will keep Prescott on his feet. If Prescott stays healthy, Dallas is a great bet to dethrone the Eagles. </span></p>
