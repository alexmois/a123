<p>I use it. Our experts use it. <strong>And you should too!</strong></p>



<p>And, it only comes around a few times a year. It’s something we call a <strong>“Super Bonus.” </strong>The last time I saw a sportsbook signup bonus this strong was six months ago.</p>



<p>If you already bet with FanDuel I&#8217;m sorry, but you can’t have this coveted offer.</p>

<p>We just got wind of this amazing promo and we believe it will get pulled very soon.</p>



<p>Here’s my view of how to leverage the Super Bonus and why I call it <em><strong>free money &#8211; even if you don’t bet big.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Deposit as much as you are comfortable with. Not everyone has $2500 in disposable cash laying around, I get that. But, remember you may have money in other books, so don’t be afraid to make that money work for you. If you don’t play at that level, simply deposit an amount that’s inline with your normal unit size. Remember, they’ll match ANY amount, not just the top dollar figure.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Use your entire bonus on one bet featuring a big favorite. Now, most offers have limits on the top end (read those terms and conditions!), usually in the -180 neighborhood. What I did when Illinois went live in 2020 was drive there and make my deposit. I then bet the whole $2500 on the Dodgers at -165. They won and it paid $1515.15 (I’ll NEVER forget that number!). I made a few more bets, pulled my original $2500 and had a nice jump start to my FanDuel account of over 1500 bucks.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do the books hate it when you do that?</em></strong></p>



<p>Oh, yeah. They definitely do. You’re beating them with their own money and they HATE that. You know why? Because they KNOW they have a built-in advantage every time you make a bet and they will eventually grind you down. They know the only way to win is beating them with their own money. Double dipping if you will. Turning your profit into more profit.</p>

<p><em>Why is FanDuel offering this?</em></p>



<p>Because they’re gambling, too.</p>



<p>They’re gambling that you’re going to blow through your bonus cash, deposit your own money, and continue losing. Now, if you know me at all or have ever seen one of my videos, you KNOW there is nothing I like more than doing exactly what the casinos and books DON’T want me to do.</p>



<p>Okay, that’s it. Hope this helps some folks out there. I also realize a lot of you have already taken advantage of previous FD offers, BUT, if you haven’t, or you can get to another state, this is probably the most amount of matching cash that’s going to be available throughout the year.</p>
