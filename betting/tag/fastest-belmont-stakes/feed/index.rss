<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year marks the 155th running of the Belmont Stakes. It is the oldest of the three races of the Triple Crown but not the most famous. The race predates the Preakness by six years and the Kentucky Derby by eight years. Unlike the other two races, however, the venue for the Belmont Stakes has changed frequently over the years as well as the length of the race. The race’s primary home has been Belmont Park since 1905 and it has been run at a mile and a half since 1926.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have only been 13 Triple Crown winners ever with the last being Justify in 2018. Since 1978, there have only been three Triple Crown winners despite eight horses arriving at Belmont Park to take their shot at immortality. Many horses have fallen victim to the demands of such a long race with so much on the line. It is why the race has been dubbed ‘The Test of a Champion’.</span></p>



<h2 id='belmont-stakes-five-fastest-finish-times'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >Belmont Stakes Five Fastest Finish Times</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the five fastest times in the storied history of the Belmont Stakes</span>.</p>



<h3 id='5-point-given-2021'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading mb-0" >#5 &#8211; Point Given, 2021</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Point Given won the Belmont with a time of 2:26.56 to claim the final two legs of the Triple Crown after being upset at the Kentucky Derby. Point Given would be named 2001 Horse of the Year.</span></p>



<h3 id='4-risen-star-1988'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading mb-0" >#4 &#8211; Risen Star, 1988</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The son of legendary Secretariat, Risen Star won the Belmont Stakes with a time of 2:26.40 to, like Point Given, avenge a poor showing at the Kentucky Derby.</span></p>



<h3 id='3-a-p-indy-1992'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >#3 &#8211; A.P. Indy, 1992</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sire of Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, A.P. Indy took home the Belmont with a time of 2:26.13. His own son, Rags to Riches, would later claim the Belmont in 2007.</span></p>



<p class="has-nv-light-bg-background-color has-background"><strong><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/2023-belmont-stakes-picks-with-exacta-trifecta-and-superfecta-predictions-591/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/2023-belmont-stakes-picks-with-exacta-trifecta-and-superfecta-predictions-591/">Click here to read our FREE Belmont Stakes Betting Strategy: Turn $1 into&nbsp;<em>hundreds</em>!</a> </strong><br>Prepared by our Horse Racing expert handicapper who nailed this year&#8217;s Kentucky Derby&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Preakness Stakes, you don&#8217;t want to miss out as he breaks down how he plans to earn his own &#8216;Triple Crown&#8217; with a third big win on the Belmont Stakes!</p>



<h3 id='2-easy-goer-1989'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >#2 &#8211; Easy Goer, 1989</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dropping the first two legs of the Triple Crown to Sunday Silence, Easy Goer took home an eight-length win at the Belmont with the second-fastest time ever of 2:26.00.</span></p>



<h3 id='1-secretariat-1973'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" >#1 &#8211; Secretariat, 1973</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the greatest horse in the history of racing, Secretariat completed the Triple Crown with a stunning performance at Belmont. He dominated the field, winning by a still unmatched 31 lengths to establish a new record of 2:24.00. Here we are, 50 years later, and despite advances in training and caring for horses, Secretariat’s record still stands by a two-second margin.</span></p>



<h2 id='biggest-longshots-ever-to-win-the-belmont-stakes'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" >Biggest Longshots ever to win the Belmont Stakes</h2>



<p>The field for the Belmont Stakes tends to narrow in the final leg of the Triple Crown but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been some monumental upsets that paid off handsomely at the betting window. Here are the five biggest upsets in the history of the Belmont Stakes.</p>



<h3 id='5-pass-catcher-1971'  id="boomdevs_8" class="wp-block-heading mb-0" >#5 &#8211; Pass Catcher, 1971</h3>



<p><em>Pass Catcher</em>&nbsp;took home the prize going off at 34.5 to 1 odds to keep&nbsp;<em>Canonero II</em>&nbsp;from winning the Triple Crown.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id='4-birdstone-2024'  id="boomdevs_9" class="wp-block-heading mb-0" >#4 &#8211; Birdstone, 2024</h3>



<p><em>Birdstone</em>&nbsp;is the most recent longshot winner of the Belmont Stakes, going off at 36-1 odds before winning the race. Like&nbsp;<em>Pass Catcher</em>, Birdstone’s performance took away a potential Triple Crown win, this time from&nbsp;<em>Smarty Jones</em>, winning by a full length.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id='3-temperance-hill-1980'  id="boomdevs_10" class="wp-block-heading" >#3 &#8211; Temperance Hill, 1980</h3>



<p><em>Temperance Hill</em>&nbsp;took home the Belmont at a staggering 53-1 odds in 1980. The upset came at the hands of the Kentucky Derby winner&nbsp;<em>Genuine Risk</em>&nbsp;and Preakness winner&nbsp;<em>Codex</em>.</p>



<h3 id='2-sherluck-1961'  id="boomdevs_11" class="wp-block-heading" >#2 &#8211; Sherluck, 1961</h3>



<p><em>Sherluck</em>&nbsp;took the Triple Crown away from&nbsp;<em>Carry Back</em>&nbsp;with an improbable win at 65-1 odds for a massive payout.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id='1-sarava-2002'  id="boomdevs_12" class="wp-block-heading" >#1 &#8211; Sarava, 2002</h3>



<p>Just over 20 years ago,&nbsp;<em>Sarava</em>&nbsp;produced the biggest upset in Belmont Stakes history with the win while going off at 70-1 odds. A mere $10 to win betting ticket would pay out $900 on this historic day.</p>
