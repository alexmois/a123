<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit took big strides forward last season in </span><a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/CampDa1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Campbell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s second year running the team as they improved from 3-13-1 in 2021 to 9-8 in 2022. The Lions started the year 1-6 but rallied to win eight of their final 10 games in the regular season, capped by a win over Green Bay in week 18 that kept the Packers out of the postseason. <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/nfl/9-7-2023/detroit-lions-vs-kansas-city-chiefs-prediction-8095/">Read more here…</a></span></p>

<p><strong> Saturday, September 9, 2023 at 12:00pm EDT</strong></p>
<p><strong> Written by Michael Briggs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coach &#8220;Prime&#8221; was the backdrop of the game, but his son Shedeur, WR/CB Travis Hunter and RB Dylan Edwards stole the show. Sanders completed 38 of his 47 passing attempts for 510 yards and four touchdowns, making the step up from the SWAC to the Power-5 level look like a cakewalk. <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/9-9-2023/nebraska-vs-colorado-prediction-5295/"><strong> Read more here…</strong></a></span></p>

<p>by <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/6">David Delano</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-medium wp-image-1215" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19709996_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19709996_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19709996_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lions, and Vikings, and Bears..oh my! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFC North should be highly competitive this season. Last season, each of the four teams in the division finished in the bottom five in the NFL in yards per play allowed defensively. With Aaron Rodgers now in New York, the Lions are favored to win their first division title since 1993.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are my OVER/UNDER win total betting predictions for the NFC North with odds provided by <a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077">Caesars Sportsbook</a>:</span></p>
<h3 id='4th-green-bay-packers-under-7-5-+120'  id="boomdevs_2" ><b>4TH: Green Bay Packers UNDER 7.5 (+120)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predicted Record 7-10</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Packers have a demanding schedule this season. Amongst the most significant challenges are road games against the Falcons, Broncos, Steelers, and Giants and home games against the Chargers and Chiefs. It will be challenging for the Packers to win more than one of those games. Whether or not Jordan Love will have this offense ready to keep up with his counterparts in the North is a big question, and considering that this team only went 8-9 with Aaron Rodgers last season, the under is the way to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id='why-go-halfway-when-you-can-go-full-caesar-snag-up-to-$1-250-in-bet-credit-if-your-first-bet-doesn-t-win'  id="boomdevs_3" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why go halfway when you can go <a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077">FULL CAESAR?</a> Snag up to $1,250 in bet credit if your first bet doesn&#8217;t win.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer:</span> <b>21+. Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id='3rd-minnesota-vikings-under-8-5-+105'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>3RD: Minnesota Vikings UNDER 8.5 (+105)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predicted Record 8-9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vikings have a challenging early schedule, playing four of their first seven games against the Eagles, Chargers, Chiefs, and 49ers. Road games at Atlanta and Denver will also be tough later on. Minnesota&#8217;s last four games on the schedule include a trip to Cincinnati and two games against the Lions. Almost everything went right for the Vikings last season, but I see regression in 2023. The under is the play here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2nd-chicago-bears-over-7-5-140'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>2ND: Chicago Bears OVER 7.5 (-140)</b></h3>
<p>Predicted record: 9-8</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bears went 3-14 last season and ended the season on a 10-game losing streak. Despite their poor record, they went 1-7 in games decided by seven points or less. This group will take a step forward in 2023. If they can win three divisional games, they’ll be in good shape to reach eight wins. Their schedule includes home games against the Raiders, Panthers, Cardinals, and Falcons and early season road games against the Buccaneers and Commanders. The Bears could be a sleeper to win the division, but there is still substantial room for improvement. Chicago&#8217;s defensive pass rush was dead last in the NFL in sacks last season which had a lot to do with the horrendous record. On the offensive side of the ball, the line was upgraded in the offseason, and with Justin Fields expected to take another step forward, I like the Bears to get to eight wins or more.</span></p>
<h3 id='1st-detroit-lions-under-9-5-+105'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>1ST: Detroit Lions UNDER 9.5 (+105)</b></h3>
<p>Predicted record: 9-8</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lions were a feel-good story last season, winning six games as an underdog and barely missing the playoffs. Although the defense should be better, I&#8217;m not ready to pencil the offense in as one of the top four in the NFL again. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the Lions have yet to win more than nine games since 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t see the Lions cruising through the NFC North and outside the division, and this group will have a hard time catching teams by surprise. The schedule has brutal matchups, including road games against the Chiefs, Ravens, Chargers, Saints, and Cowboys. I see the Lions winning eight or nine games in 2023, but not 10 or more.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1216" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19562391_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></p>
<h3 id='division-winner-detroit-lions-+120'  id="boomdevs_7" ><b>Division Winner: Detroit Lions +120</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I took the Lions to fall short of 9.5 wins, they are the best bet to win the North. Although the Lions won’t catch teams by surprise this season, the defense should be better, and they still have a higher floor than any other team in the division.</span></p>
<h3 id='if-you-are-looking-to-build-your-nfl-ncaa-football-or-mlb-bankroll-with-david-delano-or-any-of-our-other-handicappers-this-season-it-s-simple'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>If you are looking to build your NFL, NCAA Football, or MLB bankroll with David Delano or any of our other handicappers this season, it’s simple.</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Bosun Akinpelu</span></p>
<h2 id='today-we-get-into-our-nfc-west-predictions-including-the-betting-over-under-win-totals-for-the-san-francisco-49ers-arizona-cardinals-los-angeles-rams-and-seattle-seahawks'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we get into our NFC West predictions, including the betting over/under win totals for the San Francisco 49ers, Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Rams, and Seattle Seahawks.</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1203" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19792685_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFC West was expected to be the toughest division in the NFC last season after three teams made the playoffs, with the Los Angeles Rams defeating the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game en route to winning the Super Bowl. But last season, the Rams dealt with significant injuries and missed the playoffs, and the Arizona Cardinals never got going and finished with the third-worst record in the league last season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This season, expectations in the NFC West aren’t that high, with the 49ers being the only team the oddsmakers believe will win more than nine games this season. However, with the Seattle Seahawks making a surprise playoff run last season and the Rams still having a lot of talent on their roster, don’t be surprised if the division is as tough as it was two seasons ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at the 2023-24 NFC West and our predictions for the teams’ win totals. </span></p>

<h3 id='arizona-cardinals-under-4-5-wins-120-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>Arizona Cardinals UNDER 4.5 WINS (-120)</b><a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049"><b style="font-size: 16px;">@DraftKings</b></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardinals finished the 2022-23 season with a 4-13 record, which was dead last in the division. Even though they haven’t used the word yet, they are essentially rebuilding after firing head coach Kliff Kingsbury. They hired former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon as his replacement, and they’re hoping he can help quarterback Kyler Murray reach his full potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardinals didn’t make a lot of big moves in free agency. They improved their offensive line with the signing of Kelvin Beachum and Will Hernandez and acquired linebacker Kyzir White from the Eagles. But they lost their top two free agents Zach Allen and Byron Murphy Jr., while J.J. Watt retired after the season. They also released wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who led the team with 717 receiving yards despite playing only nine games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona picked up some talented players in the draft, most notably former Ohio State offensive tackle Paris Johnson Jr. and former LSU linebacker BJ Ojulari, who were picked in the first two rounds, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the rest of the division, the Cardinals have the least talented roster, and they’re expected to be without Murray, who suffered a season-ending ACL injury last season, expected to miss a few games early in the season, the Cardinals will finish last in the division once again. Go with Arizona under 4.5 wins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='los-angeles-rams-over-7-5-wins-+175-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Los Angeles Rams OVER 7.5 Wins (+175) <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049">@DraftKings</a></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defending Super Bowl champions finished the 2022-23 season with a 5-12 record, which was the worst record for a defending Super Bowl champion and their first losing season in the Sean McVay era. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to their all-in approach in recent years, the Rams didn’t have a lot of room to maneuver under the salary cap and had to get rid of big contract players like Jalen Ramsey. They also let a lot of free agents walk and had to restructure a few contracts just to sign their draft picks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Rams did add some good young talent through the draft, it might not be enough to get them back in the playoffs. However, the Rams won at least nine games in each of their previous seasons under McVay prior to last season. In 2022, the team dealt with a lot of injuries on both sides and quarterback Matthew Stafford, who entered the season with an arm injury, was limited to nine games. If Stafford is healthy, they still have enough weapons to be very good offensively. They might not make the playoffs, but they will win at least eight games this season. </span></p>

<h3 id='san-francisco-49ers-under-11-5-155-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_7" ><b>San Francisco 49ers UNDER 11.5 (-155) <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049">@DraftKings</a></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 49ers finished the 2022-23 season with a 13-4 record, which was the best in the division. Even though they dealt with injuries at the quarterback position during the season, they made it to the NFC Championship Game thanks to their third-string quarterback, Brock Purdy, who went undefeated as a starter during the regular season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdy and the 49ers’ luck ran out in the NFC Championship Game after he was knocked out with an elbow injury requiring offseason surgery. Going into the season, Purdy has been declared the starter, but it’s unclear how effective he will be this year after not throwing for most of the offseason. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 49ers lost some talented players in free agency, with offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey leaving for Denver and veteran quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo signed with Las Vegas. They also brought in players like Javon Hargrave and Sam Darnold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest stories going into the season of the 49ers is the holdout of Defensive Player of the Year, Nick Bosa, who is looking for a contract extension. Even though they still have a few weeks to go before the regular season begins, they will need him on the field if they want to contend this season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco’s win total has been set at over 11.5 at +105 and under 11.5 at -125. San Francisco is one of the best teams in the league, but the quarterback situation can be a problem for them if Purdy regresses this season because the jury is still out on Trey Lance, and Sam Darnold has underachieved so far. Even though they will win at least 10 games, they won’t win 12 games this season. </span></p>
<h3 id='seattle-seahawks-over-8-5-165-draftkings'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>Seattle Seahawks OVER 8.5 (-165) <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=274670&amp;wpcn=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;wpcrn=WinnersandWhiners+&amp;wpscid=Toplist&amp;wpscn=Bet5&amp;wpsrc=2049">@DraftKings</a></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seahawks finished the 2022-23 season with a 9-8 record and made the playoffs, which surprised a lot of people after they lost quarterback Russell Wilson to Denver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geno Smith, who had backed up Wilson for two seasons, took advantage of the opportunity to be a starter once again and won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award after throwing for 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seahawks were very active in the offseason. They resigned Smith to a new contract, brought back Bobby Wagner, who played for the Rams last season, and also signed Julian Love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They used their two first-round picks to select former Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon and former Ohio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who are expected to be impact players this season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seahawks could have won more than nine games last season if a few bounces went their way. They improved their roster in the offseason and addressed most of their biggest concerns on defense, which was one of the worst last season, so expect them to win at least nine games this season.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id='nfc-east-predictions'  id="boomdevs_1" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFC East Predictions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Paul Biagioli</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC East last season with a 14-3 regular season on their way to a Super Bowl appearance. The NFC East was intensely competitive, as it was the only division to not have a team with a losing record last season. The Eagles, Cowboys and Giants all made the playoffs. Will the division have similar success this season? Check below for my predictions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='philadelphia-eagles-under-11-5-wins-115'  id="boomdevs_2" ><strong>Philadelphia Eagles: Under 11.5 wins (-115)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eagles caught the league by surprise last season, as Jalen Hurts helped to carry his team to the Super Bowl. They did not win the Super Bowl, but there will be a hangover in Philadelphia, as this team will not come close to winning 14 games again. They are playing a first-place schedule, with non-divisional games against the Chiefs, 49ers, Bills and Jets. The league has now had an entire off-season to learn how to stop their short yardage rugby scrum play, and its efficiency will start to dwindle. Hurts upped his completion percentage, yards, passing and rushing touchdowns and decreased his interceptions from the previous season. This type of growth will not happen again and the Eagles will take a small step back this season. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dallas-cowboys-over-10-5-wins-+115'  id="boomdevs_3" ><strong>Dallas Cowboys: Over 10.5 wins (+115)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dallas currently has the third best odds to win the conference, grabbing plus money for them to reach 11 wins is the smart play. Dak Prescott has missed significant time in two of the past three years due to injury, if he stays healthy Dallas has plenty of weapons to be a top-tier offense. Tony Pollard will finally be given to opportunity to be the lead back in Dallas, even though most insiders knew he was better than Ezekial Elliott over the past two seasons. Ceedee Lamb and Michael Gallup will mature and grow with a year of continuity, and the addition of Brandin Cooks provides another quick receiver for Prescott to dump it off to. Micah Parsons is in his prime and may be the best defensive player in the league. The Cowboys have the Giants, Cardinals and Patriots in three of their first four games, so they should easily start 3-1 on the way to hitting this season over. </span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_4" ></h3>
<h3 id='new-york-giants-over-7-5-wins-+100'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>New York Giants: Over 7.5 wins (+100)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the offseason news was about Saquon Barkley, his contract, and the disrespect shown to the running back position. The overload of negative press paints the picture of a disappointing season to come, but I believe the value is on the over. Barkley got his contract, he is going to play. Daniel Jones does not need to be an elite QB for this team to get wins. Brian Daboll proved he can design an offense that doesn’t ask too much of Jones while still producing points. Jones finished as a top 10 QB in fantasy scoring due to his running ability, and the Giants added Cole Beasley and Darren Waller as two short-yardage weapons, the Giants will be able to move the chains. Take their over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='washington-commanders-under-6-5-wins-120'  id="boomdevs_6" ><strong>Washington Commanders: Under 6.5 wins (-120)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commanders used up all their luck last season. They had the best record out of any team who finished last in their division. This will not happen again, except for the part about finishing last in their division. Sam Howell only threw 19 passes last season, but is now expected to lead this offense with a brand new offensive coordinator. There have already been rumblings that the players are not getting along with OC Eric Bieniemy due to his intense coaching style. Chase Young has not been able to prove he is still an elite pass rusher after tearing his ACL two years ago. This division is too tough, and I do not trust Sam Howell to go out and win many one-score games. Washington will be in the basement of the division, with less than six wins. </span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_7" ></h3>
<h3 id='division-winner-dallas-cowboys-+190'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Division Winner: Dallas Cowboys (+190)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great value here for a strong roster. In what is likely a two-team race, I’ll give the edge to the Cowboys. They welcome in a new offensive coordinator in Brian Schottenheimer, who has already received praise from Dak Prescott. Micah Parsons leads a strong defensive unit with Trevon Diggs, Demarcus Lawrence, and Stephon Gilmore. Zach Martin and Tyron Smith anchor a strong offensive line that will keep Prescott on his feet. If Prescott stays healthy, Dallas is a great bet to dethrone the Eagles. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id='afc-east-predictions'  id="boomdevs_1" >AFC East Predictions</h3>
<p>by Paul Biagioli</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1185" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21194681_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21194681_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21194681_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Buffalo Bills won the AFC East last season with a 13-3 record. Buffalo and Miami reached the playoffs, but neither advanced past the Divisional Round. The biggest news in the division was the Jets&#8217; acquisition of Aaron Rodgers, providing the team with their highest profile quarterback since Joe Namath. Buffalo has won the division the past three seasons. Will their dominance continue? Read below to see my predictions.</span></p>
<h3 id='buffalo-bills-under-10-5-wins-+130'  id="boomdevs_2" ><strong>Buffalo Bills: Under 10.5 wins (+130)</strong></h3>
<p>The Bills are overly reliant on Josh Allen to make plays, and his bruising style of running makes him an injury risk. Their defense is beginning to age, as Von Miller, Micah Hyde, and Jordan Poyer are all 32 or older. The team is trying to downplay the preseason incidents with Stefon Diggs, but it is clear not everything is right with his relationship with the team. The Bills have a grueling schedule, they play non-divisional road games against the Chiefs, Eagles, Bengals and Chargers. This will be the year the Bills take a step back.</p>
<h3 id='get-into-the-action-this-season-with-betmgm-first-bet-offer-get-up-to-$1000-paid-back-in-bonus-bets-if-you-don-t-win'  id="boomdevs_3" ><a href="https://promo.nj.betmgm.com/en/promo/geolocator?orh=promo.betmgm.com&amp;wm=7101220">Get into the action this season with BetMGM.  First Bet Offer get up to $1000 paid back in Bonus Bets if you don’t win</a></h3>
<p><a class="" role="button" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting#collapseBetMGM" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="true">Disclaimer</a></p>
<h3 id='new-york-jets-under-9-5-wins-105'  id="boomdevs_4" ><strong>New York Jets: Under 9.5 wins (-105)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding an elite quarterback will not change everything for the Jets, and it is worth questioning if Aaron Rodgers is still elite. Tom Brady was the outlier in terms of how quarterbacks can perform in their 40s, not the norm. Rodgers will turn 40 this season, and their offensive line is not strong enough to keep him on his feet all season. Something is off with Mekhi Becton, after missing all last year with an injury, he subbed himself out of their first preseason game when the medical staff cleared him to play. The skill position players are a downgrade from what Rodgers was used to in Green Bay. Don’t buy they hype, take the under. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='miami-dolphins-over-9-5-wins-+100'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>Miami Dolphins: Over 9.5 wins (+100)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFL has become a passing league, and the Dolphins have some of the fastest receivers out there. Tyreke Hill and Jaylen Waddle may be the best wideout duo in the game, and they added Braxton Berrios as a sure handed receiver to take the short yardage passes over the middle. Tua Tagovailoa was playing excellent last season before getting injured, he is back and will look to regain his form he showed early last year. Jalen Ramsey and Christian Wilkins headline an underrated defense that will be improved from last season. The Dolphins will be a surprise team in the NFL, and will hit this over.</span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_6" ></h3>
<h3 id='new-england-patriots-over-6-5-wins-140'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>New England Patriots: Over 6.5 wins (-140)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Belichick is not a coach that will embrace tanking. It doesn’t matter what next year’s quarterback crop looks like, Belichick will find ways to win games. The Patriots won games with Matt Cassell and an aging Cam Newton at the helm, they will be able to get over six wins with Mac Jones. Juju Smith-Schuster and Mike Gesicki were added to bolster their receiving corps. The biggest addition is bringing in Bill O’Brien as offensive coordinator, filling a position that was basically vacant in the previous year. This is not Tom Brady’s Patriots, but this team will be able to win at least seven of their games.</span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_8" ></h3>
<h3 id='division-winner-miami-dolphins-+300'  id="boomdevs_9" ><strong>Division Winner: Miami Dolphins (+300)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This team cannot be slowed down. Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and Raheem Mostert create on the fastest skill position groups in the league. This is year two for Mike McDaniel and offensive coordinator Frank Smith, the offense will put up big numbers behind their play scheming. Vic Fangio joins as defensive coordinator to strengthen a unit with talent at all levels. Miami will shake things up in the league, and with these odds, they are a great bet to win the AFC East. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Bosun Akinpelu</span></p>
<h2 id='our-nfl-divisional-previews-continue-with-the-2023-afc-west-predictions-including-the-over-under-betting-win-totals-for-the-broncos-chargers-raiders-and-broncos'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our NFL divisional previews continue with the 2023 AFC West predictions, including the over/under betting win totals for the Broncos, Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last season, the AFC West was expected to be the toughest division in the NFL, due to the fact that three of the four teams finished the previous season with a winning record, and the Denver Broncos pulled off a blockbuster trade for Russell Wilson.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1199" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19212704_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19212704_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19212704_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson and the Broncos failed to live up to the high expectations, and the Las Vegas Raiders, who made the playoffs the previous season, didn’t come close to making the postseason under new head coach Josh McDaniels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Kansas City Chiefs winning their second Super Bowl in five seasons, the Los Angeles Chargers winning 10 games last season, and the Denver Broncos signing Super Bowl winner Sean Payton as their head coach, expect to see a very competitive AFC West this season. Check out the team previews and over/predictions for the AFC West below. </span></p>

<h3 id='las-vegas-raiders-under-6-5-wins-135'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>Las Vegas Raiders: UNDER 6.5 WINS (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Raiders ended their five-year playoff drought in the 2021-22 season after winning 10 games, but they failed to improve on that campaign and finished the 2022-23 season with a 6-11 record, which was third in the division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the offseason, they parted ways with veteran quarterback Derek Carr and signed former San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to take over as their signal caller. Josh Jacobs, who led the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">league in rushing last season is looking for a new contract and hasn’t been with the team in training camp, putting his status for the season in limbo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They struggled defensively last season, so it wasn’t surprising that they tried to address their defensive issues through the draft, using three of their first five picks on defensive players, which they hope will make them competitive in the division this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oddsmakers weren’t impressed with the Raiders’ offseason moves and currently have their win total for the season at 6.5. The bottom line for the Raiders is that they didn’t improve at the quarterback position, they have a disgruntled running back, and their head coach hasn’t won more than eight games in a season. They also play in a division with three teams having a legitimate chance to make the playoffs, so don’t expect them to win more than six games this season. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='denver-broncos-over-8-5-wins-105'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Denver Broncos: OVER 8.5 WINS (-105)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Broncos finished the 2022-23 season with a 5-12 record, which was the worst in the conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their big offseason acquisition, Russell Wilson, who was expected to be the piece that would end their playoff drought, didn’t look comfortable under center last season and had one if the worst seasons as a pro, with the team finishing the season with fewer wins than they had the previous season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the offseason, the Broncos fired head coach Nathaniel Hackett and hired former New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, who guided the franchise to their only Super Bowl win. They are hoping he can help them resurrect the career of Wilson like he did with fellow undersized quarterback Drew Brees, who became one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history under Payton’s leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Broncos addressed their offensive line issues with the signing of two of the best free agent linemen in tackle Mike McGlinchey and guard Ben Powers. They have a lot of depth at the receiver position with Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton, with both having over 800 yards in what was the worst-scoring offense in the league. They also drafted former Oklahoma receiver Marvin Mims Jr. in the second round of the draft and expect him to contribute this season. But, they are thin at the running back position with Javonte Williams coming off a season-ending knee injury. They signed Samaje Perine to back him up, but don’t be surprised if they add another running back before the season starts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Broncos played well last season, but their offensive struggles kept the unit on the field a lot. If Payton can get the offense back on track, the Broncos will make some noise in the AFC this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver is expected to improve this season, with oddsmakers putting their total to win more than 8.5 games at -115 odds and to win less than 8.5 games at -105. Even though I expect them to be better than they were last season, they’re not going to be as good as the Chiefs or Chargers, but they will be good enough to win nine games.</span></p>
<h3 id='los-angeles-chargers-over-9-5-wins-115'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Los Angeles Chargers: OVER 9.5 WINS (-115)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chargers finished the 2022-23 season with a 10-7 record, but they were eliminated by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wildcard round of the playoffs. They were just as good as expected offensively, but the defense didn’t live up to the preseason hype, and they weren’t able to overcome all the injuries they dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This offseason, the Chargers didn’t make a splash, but they brought in veterans like linebacker Eric Kendricks and used their first-round pick on receiver Quentin Johnston, who is expected to have an impact on their offense this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they play like they did last season, the Chargers won’t have trouble with keeping up with most teams offensively, and if their defensive stars can stay healthy this season, they might give the Chiefs a run for the AFC West title.</span></p>

<h3 id='kansas-city-chiefs-over-11-5-wins-135'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>Kansas City Chiefs: OVER 11.5 WINS (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kansas City Chiefs finished the 2022-23 season with a 14-3 record, winning the AFC West for the seventh consecutive season and picking up their second Super Bowl win in five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chiefs come into the season with most of their offensive core intact, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. Seventh-round pick Isiah Pacheco emerged as a legitimate RB1 last season after finishing with 830 yards and five touchdowns as a rookie last season. They lost wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster in the offseason, but they are high on second-round draft pick Rashee Rice and don’t expect to miss much of a beat offensively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On defense, they released Frank Clark, who had a big contract and finished with only five sacks last season. They are hoping first-round pick Felix Anudike-Uzomah will be more productive than he was.</span></p>
<h2 id='division-winner-kansas-city-chiefs-180'  id="boomdevs_9" ><b>Division Winner: Kansas City Chiefs (-180)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas City’s win total is currently at 11.5 at -110 odds to go over and -110 odds to finish under. Considering the fact that they have at least 12 wins in five straight seasons and no other teams in the AFC West have done enough to be considered legitimate threats to them, the Chiefs will not only pick up more than 11.5 wins this season but also win the AFC West.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Paul Biagioli</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AFC South was the only division in the conference to have just one team with a winning record last season. That team was the Jacksonville Jaguars, who went 9-8 and won a playoff game in the Wildcard round against the Chargers, before losing to Kansas City. Will the division full of young quarterbacks be able to find more success this season? Check below to see my predictions for the AFC South.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1221" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_19794501_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></p>
<h3 id='jacksonville-jaguars-over-9-5-wins-140'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>Jacksonville Jaguars: Over 9.5 wins (-140)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jaguars won the division in their first season pairing head coach Doug Pederson with quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Lawrence is set to take a big leap in production heading into his third season. He threw 25 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions and led the Jaguars to five straight wins to end the season and grab a playoff berth. Travis Etienne Jr. is a solid young back, and the addition of Calvin Ridley on the outside will certainly help Lawrence’s growth. The AFC South is weak, they should get at least four wins in their six divisional games. They also play the entire NFC South this season, which is the weakest division in the NFC. The Jaguars are going over ten wins this season. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='tennessee-titans-over-7-5-wins-125'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Tennessee Titans: Over 7.5 wins (-125)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Tannehill is not a top tier quarterback, but the Titans know this. Tannehill just needs to take care of the ball, and allow this running attack led by Derrick Henry to do all the dirty work. Tannehill had a career low 6 interceptions last season as Tennessee’s plan was to keep it on the ground. Henry was 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in rushing yards and in rushing TDs last season, he will be the driving force of the offense. Adding Deandre Hopkins may give them more flexibility in the passing game. Kevin Byard is a two-time First Team All-Pro at the safety position, and Jeffrey Simmons is a solid pass rusher off the edge. Tennessee will be able to go over eight wins in this division.</span></p>
<h3 id='indianapolis-colts-under-6-5-wins-+120'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Indianapolis Colts: Under 6.5 wins (+120)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson is not ready to lead an NFL team. He has breathtaking athleticism, but that does not mean he will excel immediately in the NFL. He only started 13 games in college, and his 24 TDs to 15 interceptions at Florida are not the type of passing numbers that typically impress NFL scouts. Richardson threw an interception in his preseason debut, and was not able to generate any offense in his first few drives. Jonathan Taylor is still on the PUP list, and it is rumored he wants to be traded; there is not much talent behind him at running back. Michael Pittman is their only reliable pass-catcher. The Colts are not ready to compete yet, and it will be a rocky start to the Anthony Richardson era.</span></p>
<h3 id='houston-texans-under-6-5-wins-130'  id="boomdevs_7" ><b>Houston Texans: Under 6.5 wins (-130)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This team won three games last season. They added CJ Stroud, Robert Woods, Will Anderson Jr., and a defensive-minded first time head coach in DeMeco Ryans. These additions do not equate to four additional wins. The only great player on the team is Laremy Tunsil, but there is only so much a left tackle can do. Stroud is in a tough spot, they will want to rely on the running game, but there is not enough talent on the roster for this to be a winning gameplan. Houston needs more pieces, the rebuild has started, but it will take another year of roster building to generate more wins. </span></p>
<h3 id='division-winner-jaguars-155'  id="boomdevs_8" ><b>Division Winner: Jaguars (-155)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Colts and Texans are out, neither team led by a rookie quarterback will be able to win this division. That leaves the Jaguars and the Titans, and only one of those teams have an elite quarterback entering his prime. Competence at the quarterback position will allow players like Calvin Ridley, Evan Engram and Travis Etienne Jr. to put up big numbers this year for the Jags. Doug Pederson enters his second year with this group, and success will be easier to find as the players are used to his system. The odds are (-155), only the Chiefs (-165) and the 49ers (-160) are more likely to win their division. The Jaguars have the best roster, best quarterback and a Super Bowl winning coach, they will win the AFC South. </span></p>
