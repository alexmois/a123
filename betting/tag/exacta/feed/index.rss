<p>We&#8217;re on the final Jewel of the Triple Crown with the Belmont Stakes this Saturday, June 10th! <br><br>If you&#8217;ve been following along, if you&#8217;ve seen my predictions on the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes strike gold with <strong>winning Superfecta, Trifecta, and Exacta selections!</strong></p>



<p>Our winning streak thus far has set the stage for earning our own &#8216;Triple Crown&#8217;. Those riding with me are sitting on a nice pile of cash and it&#8217;s time to go for the kill! Brace yourselves for the hat trick, that coveted third jewel.</p>

<p>I have decided to step out and take $400 from my profits so far and I&#8217;m going to share my complete betting strategy with you. But first, let me break down the horses I am favoring to get in the money one by one. </p>



<h2 id='belmont-stakes-best-horses-to-be-in-the-money'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >Belmont Stakes: Best Horses to be in the Money </h2>



<h3 id='1-tapit-shoes-analysis'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >#1 Tapit Shoes Analysis</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapit Shoes is the second longest shot on the board at 20-1 but also runs out of the #1 spot in this race. The #1 spot has taken the top prize 24 times in Belmont Stakes history. Jockey Jose Ortiz has won 51% of his mounts this year and will certainly try to hang on to the position on the rail. Leveraging your exotics with this 20-1 long shot could turn a good payout into a great payout!</span> </p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/tapit-shoes-prediction-odds-profile-for-2023-belmont-stakes-547/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/tapit-shoes-prediction-odds-profile-for-2023-belmont-stakes-547/">Click here to read our full profile on #1 Tapit Shoes and prediction for the Belmont Stakes.</a></p>



<h3 id='2-tapit-trice-analysis'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" >#2 Tapit Trice Analysis</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the #1 position has been the most successful position in the history of Belmont Stakes, Tapit Price is in a prime position coming out of the #2 spot. Jockey Luis Saez has just the 20-1 long shot Tapit Shoes to sneak past to gain the rail and put his horse in prime position to take the race. After a disappointing showing at the Derby, this horse is primed to get in the money at 3-1.</span> </p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/tapit-trice-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-2023-belmont-stakes-601/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/tapit-trice-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-2023-belmont-stakes-601/">Click here to read our full profile on #2 Tapit Trice and prediction for the Belmont Stakes.</a></p>



<h3 id='6-forte-analysis'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >#6 Forte Analysis</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, you will need to have this horse in any exotic bets you play. Too good a pedigree, too many favorable factors and the top jockey in 2023 riding Forte will get this horse in the money. Forte will need to get out quickly to avoid getting caught up in the middle of the field and get to the rail. From there, expect Ortiz Jr. to pace Forte for the final stretch in this long race. Forte will finish in the money and, I believe, in the top two.</span> </p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/forte-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-the-2023-belmont-stakes-615/" data-type="post" data-id="615">Click here to read our full profile on #6 Forte and prediction for the Belmont Stakes.</a></p>



<h3 id='7-hit-show-analysis'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >#7 Hit Show Analysis</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hit Show’s slow start at the Derby ultimately cost the horse a chance to get in the money. With a strong close, Hit Show finished fifth but I couldn’t help but think if the race was just a bit longer…Enter the Belmont Stakes, the longest of the Triple Crown races. Jockey Franco has had a great year and expect him to have Hit Show in the mix down the final stretch. At 10-1, Hit Show will add some money to any exotic bet.</span> </p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/hit-show-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-the-2023-belmont-stakes-617/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/hit-show-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-the-2023-belmont-stakes-617/">Click here to read our full profile on #7 Hit Show and prediction for the Belmont Stakes.</a></p>



<h3 id='9-red-route-one-analysis'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" >#9 Red Route One Analysis</h3>



<p>#9 <span style="font-weight: 400;">Red Route One skipped the Kentucky Derby with injury and returned for a fourth-place finish at the Preakness. I love the experience of jockey Joel Rosario here, particularly at the Belmont Stakes. Rosario will be making his 12th mount at the Belmont and going for his third win here. He also knows how to win with a long shot, doing so on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sir Winston</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in 2019. At 15-1, Red Route One will fatten up your winnings in this trifecta box.</span> </p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/red-route-one-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-the-2023-belmont-stakes-623/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/red-route-one-prediction-odds-and-profile-for-the-2023-belmont-stakes-623/">Click here to read our full profile on #9 Red Route One and prediction for the Belmont Stakes.</a></p>



<h2 id='belmont-stakes-exotic-picks-betting-strategies'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" >Belmont Stakes Exotic Picks &amp; Betting Strategies</h2>



<p>The real money in horse racing is almost always in exotic tickets and this Belmont Stakes is no different! While my top pick to win, a straight bet on <strong>#2 Tapit Trice</strong> as the favorite with probable 3-1 odds isn&#8217;t likely to pay very well. Instead, I will feature him heavily in my exotic bets which both will give me more chances to win and a share in a bigger pot!</p>



<h3 id='belmont-stakes-exacta-picks'  id="boomdevs_8" class="wp-block-heading" >Belmont Stakes Exacta Picks</h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-6 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:75%">
<p>Considering that I really like <strong>#2 Tapit Trice</strong> to win as a probable 3-1 favorite, Exacta Bets are going to be my best bet to make some decent coin on this race.</p>



<p>I will use him along side my next three favored horses to place in the money. <strong>#6 Forte, #7 Hit Show, #9 Red Route One.</strong> Specifically, featuring him in three separate $20 Exacta bets, one with each of the other horses for a total of $60 of my $400 budget wagered. </p>



<p>$20 Exacta: <strong>2-6</strong><br>$20 Exacta: <strong>2-7</strong><br>$20 Exacta: <strong>2-9</strong></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:25%">
<p class="p-3 has-nv-light-bg-background-color has-background has-small-font-size"><strong>What is an Exacta Bet in Horse Racing?</strong> An Exacta Bet is placed on which horses will win (first) and place (second), in the correct order. As an exotic bet, the payout is typically greater than the implied odds, making this an favorite of many expert Horse Racing bettors to place.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3 id='belmont-stakes-exacta-box-pick'  id="boomdevs_9" class="wp-block-heading" >Belmont Stakes Exacta Box Pick</h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-9 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:50%">
<p>$10 Exacta Box: <strong>6-7-2</strong></p>



<p>In addition to our three straight Exacta Bets, I will place a 3-horse $10 Exacta Box bet combining <strong>#2 Tapit Trice, #6 Forte, and #7 Hit Show</strong>, using up $120 of my $400 budget.</p>



<p>This acts as insurance should <strong>#2 Tapit Trice</strong> not win but still provide a sizable ticket to cash in should at least two of my favored horses win and place!</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:50%">
<p class="has-nv-light-bg-background-color has-background has-small-font-size"><strong>What is Box Bet in Horse Racing?</strong><br>Boxing the bet simply combines the selected horses in every possible way, allowing a exotic bet to win regardless of finish order. You may select more horses than the exotic bet typically requires, which will again create all of the possible combinations.<br><br>This is faster than placing all of the combined bets individually, but the ticket price will be the same as if you did.</p>

<h3 id='belmont-stakes-trifecta-box-pick'  id="boomdevs_10" class="wp-block-heading" >Belmont Stakes Trifecta Box Pick</h3>



<p>$4 Trifecta Box: <strong>6-7-2-9</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-12 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>I now have just over half my budget left, with $220 of the $400 remaining. I will use another portion towards a Trifecta Box Bet. </p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like my exacta bet, I would box an additional horse in my trifecta offerings to increase my odds</span> of having a winning ticket. </p>



<p>We will keep <strong>#6 Forte, #7 Hit Show, and #2 Tapit Trice</strong> while adding <strong>#9 Red Route One</strong> in a 4-horse $4 Trifecta Box using $96 of my remaining $220:</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<p class="p-3 has-nv-light-bg-background-color has-background has-small-font-size"><strong>What is a Trifecta Box Bet in Horse Racing?</strong> A Trifecta Box Bet is placed on which horses will win, place, and show. <br><br>As a Box bet, you do not need to get the finish order correct and you may include more than just three horses.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3 id='best-bet-belmont-stakes-superfecta-pick'  id="boomdevs_11" class="wp-block-heading" >Best Bet: Belmont Stakes Superfecta Pick</h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-15 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:75%">
<p>$1 Superfecta Box: <strong>6-7-2-9-1</strong></p>



<p>Okay, with $124 remaining, its time to make our Superfecta Pick.</p>



<p>Again, I will go with a box over a straight bet in-order to maximize our odds. We will continue with <strong>#6 Forte, #7 Hit Show, #2 Tapit Trice, and #9 Red Route One</strong> while adding a long shot to this Superfecta Box from the most decorated post position in the history of the Belmont Stakes: <strong>#1 Tapit Shoes</strong> at probable 20-1 odds!</p>



<p>This is my favorite bet to make for this race as it combines all of my favorite horses to be in the money alongside a longshot that has a legitimate chance at winning and providing bettors quite the payday!</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:25%">
<p class="p-3 has-nv-light-bg-background-color has-background has-small-font-size"><strong>What is a Superfecta Box Bet in Horse Racing?</strong> A Superfecta Box Bet is placed on which horses will finish first, second, third, and forth. <br><br>As a Box bet, you do not need to get the finish order correct and you may include more than just four horses.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3 id='bet-$4-on-2-tapit-trice-to-win-or-a-beer'  id="boomdevs_12" class="wp-block-heading" >Bet $4 on #2 Tapit Trice to Win (Or a Beer)</h3>



<p>After placing our 5-horse $1 Superfecta Box, our $400 budget is down to just $4. Typically I&#8217;d say go buy a beer for the remaining $4, however I&#8217;m not sure you can buy a beer for that anymore. So let&#8217;s bet the last $4 on <strong>#2 Tapit Trice</strong> to win!</p>

<p>If you’re reading this article, it’s likely because you crushed our Kentucky Derby exacta pick of Mage and Two Phils that paid a hefty $330.44 for a $2 wager. Yes, that’s 150-1 on your money!</p>



<p>You’re welcome!</p>



<p>Who’s ready for round two of horse racing’s biggest time of the year, the Triple Crown races? We&#8217;re here to give you the lowdown once again on how to turn your bets into straight-up cash. Embrace the &#8220;bet small to win big&#8221; concept and make the most out of our free Preakness predictions (below).</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll guide you through the ins and outs of this wild ride, from basic betting to advanced strategies like exactas and trifectas to help you make informed choices.</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/horse-racing/how-to-bet-the-preakness-5-key-questions-answered-431/" data-type="post" data-id="431">How to Bet the 2023 Preakness: 5 Key Questions Answered</a></p>



<p>Ready to get to it? Here’s a brief breakdown of who we like and why. Below is the breakdown of exactly how to construct each ticket. Newbies welcome!</p>



<p><strong>#5 Red Route One </strong>is a horse we expected to be in the money at the Derby but was pulled late in the week. Now, this horse has a shot at redemption in the Preakness. Currently, at 10-1 odds, a win would yield a sizable payout. Red Route One is trained by one of the winningest trainers in the country Steve Asmussen and ridden by legendary jockey Joel Rosario. In four starts this year, Red Route One has one win, his latest race, the Bath House Row stakes at Oaklawn Park at 1 1/8, along with two second-place finishes. Rosario has won 39% of his mounts thus far on the season.</p>



<p>Next up I like <strong>#7 Blazing Sevens</strong>, currently projected at 6-1. Blazing Sevens is trained by Chad Brown, who has two Preakness wins in his career in 2017 and again last year in 2022. Blazing Sevens will be ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr. He has won the Belmont twice and finished second in the Preakness once. This year, Ortiz Jr. has finished in the money in 59% of his rides. Blazing Sevens has finished in the money in four of his six career starts on dirt, including two wins, and a 3rd in his most recent start in Keeneland, the 1 1/8 Bluegrass Stakes.</p>



<p>Lastly, we favor <strong>#1 National Treasure</strong>, who comes in at 4-1 currently. National Treasure is under the tutelage of trainer Tim Yakteen and ridden by jockey John R. Velazquez. Velazquez has been in the money in 45% of his mounts this year and has the experience to guide this horse to the winner’s circle. National Treasure has been in the money in four out of five career starts including one win.</p>



<p>While you can certainly return to the safe plays like <strong>#3 Mage</strong> and <strong>#8 First Mission</strong>, I like the pedigree and experience backing all three of the previously listed horses. I’ve included Mage as part of all my box plays as well. I do expect Mage to be a factor in the race and it certainly pays to have the winner of the first leg of the Triple Crown in your thoughts.</p>



<h2 id='here-s-a-breakdown-of-how-i-would-allocate-a-$200-bet-in-the-race-to-swing-for-the-fences'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how I would allocate a $200 bet in the race to swing for the fences.</h2>



<p>$1 Superfecta Box: Blazing Sevens/National Treasure/Red Route One/Mage/First Mission = $120<br>$1 Trifecta Box: Blazing Sevens/National Treasure/Red Route One/Mage/ First Mission =$60<br>$1 Exacta Box: Blazing Sevens/National Treasure/Red Route One/Mage/ First Mission =$20</p>



<p>If you prefer to wager only $100, simply reduce each amount by 50%, and adjust accordingly for other amounts.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are two racebooks offering generous sign-up bonuses, which you could use to potentially increase your winnings. I’ve outlined some strategies for leveraging those bonuses.</p>



<p><strong>Option #1</strong>, <strong>AmWager: </strong>Deposit up to $150 and AmWager will match it 100%. Let AmWager fund half your wagers! It&#8217;s the perfect way to maximize your Preakness winnings. <strong><a href="https://www.amwager.com/?amwaffid=ATSWins&amp;amwpromocode=MATCH150" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amwager.com/?amwaffid=ATSWins&amp;amwpromocode=MATCH150">Click here to sign up and AmWager will give you a 100% First Deposit Match Bonus, of up to $150.</a></strong></p>
