The Braves went into the deadline first in home runs and run differential and already seemed to be the team with the fewest flaws. The Braves did make a noteworthy move to strengthen their bullpen at the deadline, acquiring Brad Hand from the Rockies. Hand has 131 career saves and should be an asset in October.<\/p>\n<h3 id='los-angeles-dodgers-+500'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" >Los Angeles Dodgers +500<\/h3>\n<p>The Dodgers&#8217; offense is elite, but their pitching staff has struggled, ranking 22nd in ERA. The Dodgers did acquire Ryan Yarbrough from the Royals but failed to land Eduardo Rodriguez from the Detroit Tigers. Rodriguez, who posted a 6-5 record and 2.95 ERA heading into August, exercised his no-trade clause and decided to stay in Detroit.<\/p>\n<h3 id='houston-astros-+600'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" >Houston Astros +600<\/h3>\n<p>The Astros made a serious move in their quest to repeat as World Champs, shipping away two of their top prospects to bring back 2022 AL Cy Young winner Justin Verlander. The Astros are getting healthy, and Framber Valdez tossed a no-hitter against Cleveland on the deadline day. The Astros hold strong value at the Bet Fred sportsbook.<\/p>\n<h3 id='tampa-bay-rays-+750'  id=\"boomdevs_7\" >Tampa Bay Rays +750<\/h3>\n<p>The Tampa Bay Rays did not stand pat at the deadline, making several moves, most notably acquiring Aaron Civale from the Cleveland Guardians. With a 5-2 record and 2.34 ERA this season, Civale will only strengthen a staff with the third-best team ERA in baseball.<\/p>\n<h3 id='texas-rangers-+850'  id=\"boomdevs_8\" >Texas Rangers +850<\/h3>\n<p>The American League Pennant has gone through Texas each of the last six seasons, but the Rangers want to expand that range further than Houston. After adding Ardolis Champman to the bullpen in late June, the Rangers made a big splash before the deadline by acquiring Max Scherzer from the Mets, along with Jordan Montgomery and Chris Stratton from the Cardinals.<\/p>\n<h3 id='baltimore-orioles-+1200'  id=\"boomdevs_9\" >Baltimore Orioles +1200<\/h3>\n<p>The Orioles might be the Rodney Dangerfield of the 2023 season. Despite having the best record in the American League, three other teams in the AL have better odds to win the World Series than Baltimore does. The Orioles have been the most profitable team for sports bettors to back this season. The birds did improve their pitching staff at the deadline by acquiring Jack Flaherty from St. Louis and delivering Logan Rinehart from Seattle. With 12-to-1 odds, the Orioles are a great option to buy low on now.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Remember that you can lock in any of these teams to win the Fall Classic at Betfred today. Along with futures, Betfred also offers great odds on traditional moneylines, totals, and player props.
