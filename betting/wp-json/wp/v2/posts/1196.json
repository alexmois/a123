Josh Jacobs, who led the<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">league in rushing last season is looking for a new contract and hasn\u2019t been with the team in training camp, putting his status for the season in limbo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They struggled defensively last season, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that they tried to address their defensive issues through the draft, using three of their first five picks on defensive players, which they hope will make them competitive in the division this season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The oddsmakers weren\u2019t impressed with the Raiders\u2019 offseason moves and currently have their win total for the season at 6.5. The bottom line for the Raiders is that they didn\u2019t improve at the quarterback position, they have a disgruntled running back, and their head coach hasn\u2019t won more than eight games in a season. They also play in a division with three teams having a legitimate chance to make the playoffs, so don\u2019t expect them to win more than six games this season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id='denver-broncos-over-8-5-wins-105'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" ><b>Denver Broncos: OVER 8.5 WINS (-105)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Broncos finished the 2022-23 season with a 5-12 record, which was the worst in the conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their big offseason acquisition, Russell Wilson, who was expected to be the piece that would end their playoff drought, didn\u2019t look comfortable under center last season and had one if the worst seasons as a pro, with the team finishing the season with fewer wins than they had the previous season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the offseason, the Broncos fired head coach Nathaniel Hackett and hired former New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, who guided the franchise to their only Super Bowl win. They are hoping he can help them resurrect the career of Wilson like he did with fellow undersized quarterback Drew Brees, who became one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history under Payton\u2019s leadership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Broncos addressed their offensive line issues with the signing of two of the best free agent linemen in tackle Mike McGlinchey and guard Ben Powers. They have a lot of depth at the receiver position with Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton, with both having over 800 yards in what was the worst-scoring offense in the league. They also drafted former Oklahoma receiver Marvin Mims Jr. in the second round of the draft and expect him to contribute this season. But, they are thin at the running back position with Javonte Williams coming off a season-ending knee injury. They signed Samaje Perine to back him up, but don\u2019t be surprised if they add another running back before the season starts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, the Broncos played well last season, but their offensive struggles kept the unit on the field a lot. If Payton can get the offense back on track, the Broncos will make some noise in the AFC this season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Denver is expected to improve this season, with oddsmakers putting their total to win more than 8.5 games at -115 odds and to win less than 8.5 games at -105. Even though I expect them to be better than they were last season, they\u2019re not going to be as good as the Chiefs or Chargers, but they will be good enough to win nine games.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id='los-angeles-chargers-over-9-5-wins-115'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" ><b>Los Angeles Chargers: OVER 9.5 WINS (-115)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers finished the 2022-23 season with a 10-7 record, but they were eliminated by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wildcard round of the playoffs. They were just as good as expected offensively, but the defense didn\u2019t live up to the preseason hype, and they weren\u2019t able to overcome all the injuries they dealt with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This offseason, the Chargers didn\u2019t make a splash, but they brought in veterans like linebacker Eric Kendricks and used their first-round pick on receiver Quentin Johnston, who is expected to have an impact on their offense this season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they play like they did last season, the Chargers won\u2019t have trouble with keeping up with most teams offensively, and if their defensive stars can stay healthy this season, they might give the Chiefs a run for the AFC West title.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id='every-point-matters-in-the-nfl-so-you-want-to-have-access-to-multiple-sportsbooks-take-advantage-of-the-limited-time-first-time-deposit-bonuses-here'  id=\"boomdevs_7\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every point matters in the NFL, so you want to have access to multiple <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sportsbooks.

Seventh-round pick Isiah Pacheco emerged as a legitimate RB1 last season after finishing with 830 yards and five touchdowns as a rookie last season. They lost wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster in the offseason, but they are high on second-round draft pick Rashee Rice and don\u2019t expect to miss much of a beat offensively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On defense, they released Frank Clark, who had a big contract and finished with only five sacks last season. They are hoping first-round pick Felix Anudike-Uzomah will be more productive than he was.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id='division-winner-kansas-city-chiefs-180'  id=\"boomdevs_9\" ><b>Division Winner: Kansas City Chiefs (-180)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas City\u2019s win total is currently at 11.5 at -110 odds to go over and -110 odds to finish under. Considering the fact that they have at least 12 wins in five straight seasons and no other teams in the AFC West have done enough to be considered legitimate threats to them, the Chiefs will not only pick up more than 11.5 wins this season but also win the AFC West.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking for help this football season or in the preseason? <a href=\"https:\/\/experts.winnersandwhiners.com\/\">Check out our Experts.<\/a><\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And remember, every point matters in the NFL, so you want to have access to multiple sportsbooks. <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/winnersandwhiners.com\/betting\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of the limited-time first-time deposit bonuses here!<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2023 AFC West Predictions and Over\/ Under NFL betting odds By Bosun Akinpelu Our NFL divisional previews continue with the 2023 AFC West predictions, including the over\/under betting win totals for the Broncos, Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos.
