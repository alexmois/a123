ESPN has begun to dive into the gambling world; they highlight the spread of games, air commercials for FanDuel and DraftKings, and have even created a show solely covering sports gambling called The Daily Wager. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said, &#8220;Our primary focus is always to serve sports fans and we know they want both betting content and the ability to place bets with less friction from within our products. The strategy here is simple: to give fans what they&#8217;ve been requesting and expecting from ESPN.&#8221; The launch of ESPN Bet is the next step in the progression toward fully embracing the legalization of sports gambling.<\/p>\n<div class=\"col-lg-3 col-md-6\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com\/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone \" src=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/caesars-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"131\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-3 col-md-6\">\n<h2 id='get-$250-in-bonus-bets'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" id=\"get-$250-in-bonus-bets\" >Get $250 in Bonus Bets<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-3 col-md-6\">\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block\" role=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com\/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Claim Offer<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-center mt-3\">Use Promo Code:\u00a0<span class=\"border rounded px-3 py-1 text-center bg-light font-weight-bold\">WAWMETAGET<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-3 col-md-6\"><a role=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/winnersandwhiners.com\/betting#collapseCaesars\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">Disclaimer<\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>ESPN Bet is on schedule to be released in Fall 2023, with reports saying it will be live before Thanksgiving in an attempt to not miss much of the NFL action.
