Yes, that\u2019s 150-1 on your money!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re welcome!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who\u2019s ready for round two of horse racing\u2019s biggest time of the year, the Triple Crown races? We&#8217;re here to give you the lowdown once again on how to turn your bets into straight-up cash. Embrace the &#8220;bet small to win big&#8221; concept and make the most out of our free Preakness predictions (below).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll guide you through the ins and outs of this wild ride, from basic betting to advanced strategies like exactas and trifectas to help you make informed choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/horse-racing\/how-to-bet-the-preakness-5-key-questions-answered-431\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"431\">How to Bet the 2023 Preakness: 5 Key Questions Answered<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to get to it? Here\u2019s a brief breakdown of who we like and why. Below is the breakdown of exactly how to construct each ticket. Newbies welcome!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#5 Red Route One <\/strong>is a horse we expected to be in the money at the Derby but was pulled late in the week. Now, this horse has a shot at redemption in the Preakness. Currently, at 10-1 odds, a win would yield a sizable payout. Red Route One is trained by one of the winningest trainers in the country Steve Asmussen and ridden by legendary jockey Joel Rosario. In four starts this year, Red Route One has one win, his latest race, the Bath House Row stakes at Oaklawn Park at 1 1\/8, along with two second-place finishes. Rosario has won 39% of his mounts thus far on the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up I like <strong>#7 Blazing Sevens<\/strong>, currently projected at 6-1. Blazing Sevens is trained by Chad Brown, who has two Preakness wins in his career in 2017 and again last year in 2022. Blazing Sevens will be ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr. He has won the Belmont twice and finished second in the Preakness once. This year, Ortiz Jr. has finished in the money in 59% of his rides. Blazing Sevens has finished in the money in four of his six career starts on dirt, including two wins, and a 3rd in his most recent start in Keeneland, the 1 1\/8 Bluegrass Stakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, we favor <strong>#1 National Treasure<\/strong>, who comes in at 4-1 currently. National Treasure is under the tutelage of trainer Tim Yakteen and ridden by jockey John R. Velazquez. Velazquez has been in the money in 45% of his mounts this year and has the experience to guide this horse to the winner\u2019s circle. National Treasure has been in the money in four out of five career starts including one win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can certainly return to the safe plays like <strong>#3 Mage<\/strong> and <strong>#8 First Mission<\/strong>, I like the pedigree and experience backing all three of the previously listed horses. I\u2019ve included Mage as part of all my box plays as well. I do expect Mage to be a factor in the race and it certainly pays to have the winner of the first leg of the Triple Crown in your thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id='here-s-a-breakdown-of-how-i-would-allocate-a-$200-bet-in-the-race-to-swing-for-the-fences'  id=\"boomdevs_1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how I would allocate a $200 bet in the race to swing for the fences.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>$1 Superfecta Box: Blazing Sevens\/National Treasure\/Red Route One\/Mage\/First Mission = $120<br>$1 Trifecta Box: Blazing Sevens\/National Treasure\/Red Route One\/Mage\/ First Mission =$60<br>$1 Exacta Box: Blazing Sevens\/National Treasure\/Red Route One\/Mage\/ First Mission =$20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to wager only $100, simply reduce each amount by 50%, and adjust accordingly for other amounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are two racebooks offering generous sign-up bonuses, which you could use to potentially increase your winnings. I\u2019ve outlined some strategies for leveraging those bonuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option #1<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>AmWager:\u00a0<\/strong>Deposit up to $150 and AmWager will match it 100%. Let AmWager fund half your wagers!
