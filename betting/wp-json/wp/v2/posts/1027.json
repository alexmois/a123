He has also recorded 106 strikeouts this season and the Rockies strike out the ninth most. They will have a few dreadful innings and Garrett will be able to pitch deep into this game. Pick Braxton Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts and trust him at home.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id=''  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n<h3 id='ranger-suarez-over-3-5-strikeouts-120'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Ranger Suarez Over 3.5 Strikeouts (-120)<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Philadelphia has been one of the hottest teams in the MLB as of late and so has Ranger Suarez. The LHP has recorded 62 strikeouts this season and the Guardians have struggled at the plate at different times this season. Suarez has also recorded at least 4 strikeouts in 4 of his last 5 starts. He will stay solid in this one and push this total over the number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='andrew-heaney-under-6-5-strikeouts-160'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Andrew Heaney Under 6.5 Strikeouts (-160)<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This number is simply too high, as Heaney has been cold as of late. He has lost three of his last four starts and the Dodgers have shown that they can show up at the dish. He won\u2019t pitch deep enough into this game to push his strikeouts total over the number. L.A. is (8-2) in their last 10 and Heaney hasn\u2019t recorded more than four strikeouts in his last two games. He\u2019s cold right now and his total will remain under the number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 id='-1'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >\u00a0<\/h4>\r\n<h4 id='total-parlay-odds-+427-on-draft-kings'  id=\"boomdevs_7\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Total Parlay Odds: +427 on Draft Kings<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When betting on MLB player props, finding the hottest and coldest players is key. Finding these trends allows you to have a leg up on your competition. Because when someone is HOT, they\u2019re more than likely going to stay on FIRE!
