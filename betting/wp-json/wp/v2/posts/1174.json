This will be his second start with the Astros this season, as I believe he will be settled down and ready to attack. The Angels have also struggled since the All-Star break, as I believe this is a perfect matchup for Verlander. Los Angeles is only hitting .220 as a team in their last five games, and they\u2019re only 3-7 in their last 10. They\u2019re going to struggle at the dish on the road, and Verlander is going to look like his old self. I see him pitching deep into this game, and he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in four of his last five starts. His consistency is there, and with this incredible matchup, I see him dominating. Take Justin Verlander to record over 6.5 strikeouts. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-16-5-outs-recorded-120'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>Andrew Abbott Over 16.5 Outs Recorded (-120)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love this bounce-back spot for Abbott against the struggling Pirates. Pittsburgh is only hitting .233 as a team this season, and I expect Abbott to be extremely motivated in this game. He struggled in his last start, but he\u2019s been a road warrior all year. He is currently 4-1 with a 3.16 ERA on the road, and he has covered this line in four of his last 5 starts. He\u2019s shown that he can show up on the road, and I love this matchup for him. Take Andrew Abbott to record more than 16.5 Outs in today\u2019s game.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='xzavion-curry-under-5-5-hits-allowed-135'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>Xzavion Curry Under 5.5 Hits Allowed (-135)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I honestly don\u2019t think Curry is going to pitch deep enough into this game for the Rays to record six hits against him. He is averaging 2.2 innings pitched per game and he\u2019s only given up more than 2 hits once in his last four games played. But, he\u2019s been consistent over his last 10 games played, as well. He is only allowing 1.8 hits per game in his last 10, as I trust him to show up in this one. Take Xzavion Curry to allow less than 5.5 hits. He won\u2019t pitch deep enough into this game for the Rays to have the opportunity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='mason-folz-s-total-parlay-odds-parlay-odds-+464'  id=\"boomdevs_7\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>Mason Folz&#8217;s Total Parlay Odds: Parlay Odds: +464<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, each of these MLB player prop bets is its own separate entity, but they all have one theme in common. All three of these pitchers have shown that they can get the job done for us in the past and, in Curry&#8217;s case, get the job done by falling short of the number. So, I\u2019m trusting them again today. Betting on parlays and player props can be risky, and that\u2019s exactly why I am turning to my \u201cOld Reliables\u201d. When your back is against the wall, and you desperately need something to hit, you go to your most trusted players or team! And that is exactly what we are doing today. Good luck today, and let\u2019s cash some tickets!<\/span>\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Mason Folz It&#8217;s Friday, which means we are back with the best MLB player props for today that go together well in a parlay!\u00a0 Today, I am going to trust three pitchers that I have been consistently backing all season, one way or another.
