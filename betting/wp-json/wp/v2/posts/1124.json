Robinson was the number 8 pick out of Texas, and will play a big role in Atlanta\u2019s offensive attack this season. Rookie running backs adjust to league easily; last season three of the top 15 rushers were rookies. The Falcons are starting the inexperienced Desmond Ridder at quarterback, and will not rely on him to sling the ball all over the field constantly. Atlanta led the NFL in rushing attempts last season, and was third in rushing yards, which is impressive considering their best back was Tyler Allgeier. The Falcons do not trust their quarterback yet, and Robinson is the most talented runner on the roster by far. He will get plenty of opportunities out of the backfield, and if he stays healthy is a strong bet to win Rookie of the Year.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Bryce Young (+500)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young is slated to take over the starting QB spot in Carolina after being the first overall selection in the draft. The Panthers added skill players Miles Sanders, Adam Thielen, and DJ Chark to boost their offensive production. Young was 23-4 as a starter at Alabama, and threw 80 touchdowns against 12 interceptions. The 2021 Heisman Trophy winner has a strong chance to win his division against the Brady-less Buccaneers, and the rebuilding Saints and Falcons. If Young can lead his the Panthers into the playoffs, he will have a great shot at taking the ROTY Award.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Anthony Richardson (+600)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The athletic quarterback who was recently seen on Instagram throwing down a tomahawk dunk is going to challenge for the starting spot in Indianapolis. He will have to beat out Gardner Minshew, but considering the Colts took him 4<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> overall, the ownership and fan base will not be willing to wait long to see Richardson under center. Athletic quarterbacks have an early advantage because they can always tuck the ball and run as they are learning to read NFL defenses. The Colts just hired a new offensive coach, and he will likely want to use his most explosive offensive weapon early. The only concern with Richardson is if Mishew gets hot early, and wins some games to keep to starting job long enough to diminish Richardson\u2019s ROTY chances.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id='tough-luck-on-your-first-bet-betrivers-has-got-you-covered-with-a-second-chance-bet-up-to-$100'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" ><strong>Tough luck on your first bet?

Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen were their top receivers for multiple years as a fifth round pick and undrafted prospect respectively. The Vikings obviously struck gold with Justin Jefferson at the 22<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nd<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pick, and may have done it again with Addison at 23<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> overall. The Vikings lost Dalvin Cook, and Kirk Cousins may be running out of time as a starting quarterback in the league, pushing him to put up big numbers. Jefferson will draw the top corner of every team, giving Addison a chance to put up big numbers as the number two receiver for Minnesota.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/experts.winnersandwhiners.com\/\">If you are looking for help this football season or in the preseason?
