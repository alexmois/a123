He got his swing going in the home run derby this past week and he has a very favorable matchup. The Royals will be starting Alec Marsh and I simply don\u2019t trust him. He is (0-2) on the year and he already has a 7.00 ERA. He will make multiple mistakes early and I expect Arozarena to cash in.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id=''  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n<h3 id='luis-roberts-jr-to-record-one-hit-250'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Luis Roberts Jr. to Record One Hit (-250)<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Can you spot the trend? I\u2019m riding with another All-Star with this pick, as I believe the the Chicago White Sox slugger is primed for a massive second half of the year. He was very impressive through the first 90 games, but he\u2019s only going to get better from here. He is currently hitting .271 and he has a solid matchup in this one. Atlanta will start Charlie Morton on the mound, as he hasn\u2019t impressed me much this season, with just a (4-3) record and 4.12 ERA at home. He will make multiple mistakes and Roberts Jr. will find a way to record one hit in this game.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='-1'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n<h3 id='willy-adames-to-record-one-hit-265'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Willy Adames to Record One Hit (-265)<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I am stepping away from our All-Stars trend with this pick, as I am targeting the Red\u2019s starting pitcher. Cincinnati will be starting Graham Ashcraft on the mound and he struggled through the first half of the year. He is only (4-6) and he has a 6.28 ERA. But, that ERA actually jumps up to 7.95 when he is at home. Adames also played great against the Reds before the break, finishing with five hits in their three game series. I expect the Milwaukee Brewers shortstop to stay hot in this one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 id='-2'  id=\"boomdevs_7\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >\u00a0<\/h4>\r\n<h4 id='parlay-odds-+162-on-draft-kings'  id=\"boomdevs_8\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Parlay odds +162 on Draft Kings<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many different ways that you can attack these Player Prop bets, which is exactly why I love them! We have no limits and we don\u2019t have to focus on an entire team. Just key in on your favorite matchups and get ready to land back in the GREEN! These Player Props also allow you to focus on specific aspects of the game. For example, today we trust these players at the plate. But, just a few weeks back, we only talked about pitchers! Each day changes, but we always have the ability to cash in! So, get ready! Let\u2019s start the weekend STRONG with our parlay today!<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Betting on player props in any sport is a tough task. It takes a lot of research and you always have to know who is hot! But, Mason has taken care of that for you today. He has kept his head in the books and he KNOWS that these three players have 5 STAR matchups today! So, ride with Mr. Folz and his MLB Player Prop Parlay today and develop your passion for betting on props!<\/em><\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The MLB season is back and so is our Expert Handicapper Mason Folz, who has dove deep into Draft Kings Sportsbook to find his favorite MLB Player Props for Friday July 14, and set you up with a winner!
