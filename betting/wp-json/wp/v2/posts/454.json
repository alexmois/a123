I\u2019m talking about Horse Racing, and specifically the Kentucky Derby this weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Know nothing about horses? That\u2019s fine, stick with me here and I\u2019ll explain why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I have a sign-up offer from our partners at Daily Racing Form which will give you $10 free for just signing up. No need to deposit anything! (Offer expired,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/winnersandwhiners.com\/articles\/get-set-to-freakin-crush-it-at-the-kentucky-derby-parlay-bettors-all-ears-predictions-below__ca+8157\">click here<\/a>\u00a0for this year&#8217;s best offers.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I am going to give you the exact wagers that have the best chance to turn that free $10 into $20k that you can take home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still skeptical? Let me explain what makes Horse Racing different from sports betting and why I love the ponies and you should too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='why-you-should-bet-on-horse-racing'  id=\"boomdevs_1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>Why you should bet on Horse Racing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In horse racing, all wagers are done in a pool. The track and government take a fixed cut out of this pool, and the rest are divided up among the winners of the bet. On a normal race day, the payout is typically fairly inline with the odds. But during a big race day, the general public will throw in a lot of money on favorites as a \u201csure thing\u201d. This massively inflates the pool and allows smart bettors to pocket that money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See where I am going with this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kentucky Derby is the biggest day in horse racing, which also makes it the biggest pool available. Typically more than $200,000,000 is wagered with the vast majority of that by spectators and casual bettors just wanting to turn $2 into $5 by piling on the favorite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the favorite has only won 5 out of the last 34 derbies. That\u2019s equivalent to 8-1 odds, but the favorites are always listed as 3-1 or even 3-2. Clearly there isn\u2019t any money to be made taking the favorite, but the public is going to do it anyway every single time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a good thing though, because that means the pool is bigger for the sharp bettors to cash in big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why you can turn $10 into $20,000 during the Kentucky Derby and why I love the ponies so much!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to get a taste of the action, especially with our friends at DRF giving you a free $10 to get started with for just signing up! (Click here to get that offer)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='my-$10-superfecta-strategy'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>My $10 Superfecta Strategy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the main event, Race 12 of the Kentucky Derby, I really like the following horses:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#9 &#8211; Tiz the Bomb<br>#15 &#8211; White Abarrio<br>#16 &#8211; Cyber Knife<br>#6 &#8211; Messier<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like #9 to win, #15 and #16 to be second or third, and #6 to be fourth. I also like horses #3, 8, and 10 as possible contenders for fourth place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A $1 superfecta bet on this race is projected to pay over $20,000. So we\u2019re going to use your free $10 to create 10 superfecta bets using these horses to increase our odds of hitting the jackpot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what the bets look like &#8211; don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll explain how to place them in a moment:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>$1 Superfecta:<br>9 with 15, 16 with 15, 16, with 3, 6, 8, 10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>$1 Superfecta:<br>15 with 9 with 16 with 6<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>$1 Superfecta:<br>16 with 9 with 15 with 6<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to go up to the window at Churchill Downs, you could say this to the teller and they would understand it perfectly and ask for $10 and give you your betting slips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you can do this from the comfort of your home (legal in all states!) using DRF Bets. I\u2019ll walk you through how to place these bets one by one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='online-horse-betting-walkthrough'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Online HOrse Betting <strong>Walkthrough<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 1: Use this link to sign up with DRF and get your free $10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 2: First thing Saturday morning, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bets.drf.com\/churchill-downs\">https:\/\/bets.drf.com\/churchill-downs<\/a>&nbsp;and select race 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 3: Where it says \u201cSelect Wager Type\u201d, choose \u201cSPR\u201d. This is for Superfecta, a bet on the top 4 places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 4: Click \u201c$ Enter\u201d and enter $1 as the wager amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 5: Select horse 9 for 1st place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 6: Select horse 15 and 16 for 2nd place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 7: Select horses 15 and 16 for 3rd place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 8: Select horses 3,6,8, and 10 for 4th place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 9: This should give you a total wager of $8, click place bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations, you\u2019ve just placed your first exotic ticket! All this did was create a seperate superfecta bet for each possible combination of the selections we made, which is 8 total.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 10: Return to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bets.drf.com\/churchill-downs\">https:\/\/bets.drf.com\/churchill-downs<\/a>&nbsp;and select race 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 11: Where it says \u201cSelect Wager Type\u201d, choose \u201cSPR\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 12: Click \u201c$ Enter\u201d and enter $1 as the wager amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 13: Select horse 15 for 1st, horse 9 for 2nd, horse 16 for 3rd, and horse 6 for fourth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 14: Click Place bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We placed this bet in case #15 comes in first instead of #9, pushing #16 to third. If you\u2019re keen to put some money up, go ahead and add 3,8 and 10 for fourth to increase your chances of winning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 15: Return to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bets.drf.com\/churchill-downs\">https:\/\/bets.drf.com\/churchill-downs<\/a>&nbsp;and select race 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 16: Where it says \u201cSelect Wager Type\u201d, choose \u201cSPR\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 17: Click \u201c$ Enter\u201d and enter $1 as the wager amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 18: Select horse 16&nbsp; for 1st, horse 9 for 2nd, horse 15 for 3rd, and horse 6 for fourth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 19: Click Place bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the previous bet, we\u2019re creating this one as a contingency should #16 come in first, pushing #9 to second and #15 to third. We\u2019d typically suggest keeping 3,8,10 as fourth place options, but that would go over our budget of $10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All 10 of these bets are high risk, but we\u2019re putting the odds in our favor both through sharp handicapping as well as sharp betting strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='bonus-$50-strategy'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>Bonus $50 Strategy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re willing to put a little more money in, I would suggest this strategy for $50 budget:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>$10 Win on 9<br>$1 Exacta Box: 9, 15, 16 ($6 total)<br>$1 Straight Trifecta: 9, 15,16 with 9,15,16, with 6,15,16 ($10)<br>$1 Straight Superfecta: 9,15,16 with 9,15,16 with 9,15,16 with 3.6,8,10, ($24)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The $10 winner could pay $300, the $1 exacta could pay $250, the $1 trifecta could pay $1600, and the superfecta as much as $20,000!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This slip pretty optimally combines the horses I feel are best to increase the odds of a winning bet paying out. If you want to bet more, I\u2019d just increase the wager size proportionately across this strategy making your payout even bigger!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Easy step by step guide on how to bet my $10 budget superfecta strategy with projected payout of over $20,000!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_uag_custom_page_level_css":"","neve_meta_sidebar":"","neve_meta_container":"","neve_meta_enable_content_width":"off","neve_meta_content_width":70,"neve_meta_title_alignment":"","neve_meta_author_avatar":"","neve_post_elements_order":"","neve_meta_disable_header":"","neve_meta_disable_footer":"","neve_meta_disable_title":"","_ti_tpc_template_sync":false,"_ti_tpc_template_id":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[37,21],"tags":[36,35],"ppma_author":[32],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.1 (Yoast SEO v21.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Kentucky Derby Superfecta Betting Strategy to turn $10 into $20,000 - Winners &amp;
