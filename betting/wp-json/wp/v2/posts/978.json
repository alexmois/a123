Pirates centerfielder Jack Suwinksi has faced Diamondbacks starter Zac Gallen six times in his career, with three doubles. No matter who the opposing pitcher has been lately, Suwinski has also been on fire. He is batting .417 with three home runs and 10 RBI over his last eight games, collecting at least one hit in seven of those contests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='trea-turner-over-0-5-hits-250'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Trea Turner Over 0.5 HitS (-250)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is a bit juicy, so I recommend including it in a parlay. Trea Turner has hit safely in 10 of his last 12 games and has collected at least two hits in four of his previous seven contests. Turner has also batted .400 against the Marlins starter Sandy Alcantara in 30 at-bats. To make matters even better for Turner, this current version of Alcantara is struggling allowing 31 hits and 15 earned runs in his last 24.1 innings of work.<br>Back Turner with confidence to get at least one hit tonight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-7-5-strikeouts-+115'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Andrew Abbott Over 7.5 Strikeouts (+115)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rookie Southpaw is on a roll with 30 strikeouts over his last 19.2 innings of work, recording at least eight strikeouts in each of his previous three outings. This past Sunday, Abbott struck out 12 San Diego Padres batters with the Reds improving to 6-0 in the games he has started. I am backing Abbott to mow down at least eight Brewers tonight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id='parlay-odds-+416-on-betmgm'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><strong>Parlay Odds: +416 on BETMGM<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Betting on player props in any sport is a challenging task. It takes a lot of research, and you must lock in on the long-term data and recent patterns. Luckily David Delano has done the leg work for you, so ride his three-team player prop player today!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most bettors focus on picking winning teams and totals.
