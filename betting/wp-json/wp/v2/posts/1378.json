Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU\u2019s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id='over-under-win-total-best-bets'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" id=\"over-under-win-total-best-bets\" >Over\/Under Win Total Best Bets:<\/h2>\n<h3 id='kentucky-wildcats-over-7'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" id=\"kentucky-wildcats-over-7\" ><strong>Kentucky Wildcats over 7\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id='bet-on-your-favorite-sec-team-today-sign-up-for-fanduel-\u27a1\ufe0f-here-\u2b05\ufe0f-and-get-get-$100-in-bonus-bets-+-$100-off-on-the-sunday-nfl-ticket'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" id=\"bet-on-the-wildcats-win-total-today-sign-up-for-fanduel-\u27a1\ufe0f-here-\u2b05\ufe0f-and-get-get-$100-in-bonus-bets-+-$100-off-on-the-sunday-nfl-ticket\" >Bet on your favorite SEC team today!

Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.<\/p>\n<p>The coaching staff is solid but after losing Bryce Young to the NFL, Alabama has a three-man battle for the starting QB with Jalen Milroe, last season\u2019s backup, the front runner. Alabama punched the over ticket last season, while finishing 4th overall in total offense but will not have the talent this season on that side of the ball as they did last year. The defense was 9th overall last season in points allowed but gave up 84 points in their two losses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id='sleeper-tennessee-volunteers-+1-500-to-win-sec-fanduel'  id=\"boomdevs_9\" id=\"sleeper-tennessee-volunteers-+1-500-to-win-sec-fanduel\" ><strong>Sleeper: Tennessee Volunteers +1,500 to win SEC @<a href=\"http:\/\/wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com\/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FanDuel<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game.

Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are looking to bet on College Football this season, follow the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/experts.winnersandwhiners.com\/\">Hottest Cappers<\/a>\u00a0on WinnersandWhiners.com and head over to our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/winnersandwhiners.com\/betting\">Sportsbook<\/a>\u00a0page for bonus codes and more offers.
