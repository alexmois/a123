The positions are given based on a random draw prior to the running of the race. With twenty stalls across the track, things can get crowded. The #1 position is right near the rail. If that horse happens to get right out and hug the rail, the horse will have a shorter ride. Conversely, the 20th position is the furthest away from the rail and that horse may have trouble navigating back towards the middle of the track. Staying outside would result in the longest track to cover in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the inside positions are more favorable since the distance to the first turn is the quickest and can allow a horse to save energy by hanging on the rail. The outside positions require a horse to exert more energy earlier in the race to get toward the middle of the track and ultimately run a longer race. The odds of a horse winning usually change based on the post position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.twinspires.com\/bet\/offers\/TWIN400\/details?&amp;utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_medium=IncomeAccess&amp;utm_term=2870\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\"><strong>Click here to sign up with TwinSpires and their $400 sign-up Bonus<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id='2023-kentucky-derby-post-positions'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >2023 Kentucky Derby Post Positions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>1) Hit Show, 30-1<\/td><td> 11) Disarm, 30-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2) Verifying, 15-1<\/td><td>12) Jace\u2019s Road, 15-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3) Two Phil&#8217;s, 12-1<\/td><td>13) Sun Thunder, 30-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4) Confidence Game, 20-1&nbsp;<\/td><td>14) Angel of Empire, 8-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5) Tapit Trice, 5-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/td><td>15) Forte, 3-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6) Kingsbarns, 12-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/td><td>16) Raise Cain, 15-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7) Reincarnate, 50-1&nbsp;<\/td><td>17) Derma Sotogake, 10-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8) Mage, 15-1&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/td><td>18) Rocket Can, 15-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9) Skinner, 20-1&nbsp;<\/td><td>19) Lord Miles, 30-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10) Practical Move, 10-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/td><td>20) Continuar, 50-1<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>* Odds Courtesy of Draftkings<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id='history-of-kentucky-derby-winners-at-each-position'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >HIstory of Kentucky Derby Winners at Each Position<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Position #<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Number of Wins<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Last Winner (Year)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#1<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>Ferdinand (1986)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#2<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>Affirmed (1978)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#3<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>Real Quiet (1998)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>Super Saver (2010)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#5<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>Always Dreaming (2017)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#6<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>Sea Hero (1993)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#7<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>Justify (2018)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>Medina Spirit (2021)*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#9<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>Riva Ridge (1972)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#10<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>Giacomo (2005)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#11<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>Winning Colors (1988)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#12<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>Canonero II (1971)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#13<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>Nyquist (2016)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#14<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>Carry Back (1961)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#15<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>Authentic (2020)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#16<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>Animal Kingdom (2011)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#17<\/td><td>0<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#18<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>Country House (2019)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#19<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>I&#8217;ll Have Another (2012)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#20<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>Big Brown (2008), <br>Rich Strike (2022)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>*Medina Spirit was disqualified after the fact in 2021 <\/em><br><em>History of post-position wins courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.covers.com\/horse-racing\/kentucky-derby\/post-position\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.covers.com\/horse-racing\/kentucky-derby\/post-position\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Covers.com<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick look at the history of post-position wins reveals that Tapit Trice at 5-1 in the fifth position might be a solid play.
