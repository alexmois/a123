The three players below have all been playing consistently this season, and more importantly, they\u2019ve been hot as of late. So, ride with these studs today, and let\u2019s look to get rich quickly! <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, we came up one strikeout short, so I know we are right there!<\/span> When making a player prop parlay, I like to lean on the conservative side. I don\u2019t take many risky picks just because I want my bet to have the best possibility of winning. I also like to focus on the hottest teams and the hottest players, as they are more than likely going to be your best bet. When a professional baseball player goes on a streak, it is hard for anyone to stop them. So, notice that trend today and get ready to get back into the green! <a href=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/online-sports-betting\/how-to-make-parlaying-player-props-work-for-you-945\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Make Player Props Work for You!<\/a><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"py-3 border mb-3 d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center\">\r\n<div class=\"col-12 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full mr-3\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/draftkings-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" \/>\r\n<h4 id='acf-field=-draftkings-generic-promo-text-post-id=-options'  id=\"boomdevs_1\" class=\"mb-0 pb-0\" >Bet $5 Get $200 Instantly + Up to $150 in No Sweat Bets<\/h4>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"col-12 col-md-6\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-block\" role=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/dksb.sng.link\/As9kz\/tnvk?_dl=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;_fallback_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;pcid=274670&amp;psn=2049&amp;pcn=xx&amp;pscn=Bet5&amp;pcrn=WinnersandWhiners&amp;pscid=Toplist&amp;pcrid=xx&amp;_ios_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;_android_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grab the Offer Now!<\/a>\r\n<div class=\"col-12 px-1\"><a role=\"button\" href=\"#collapse125\" data-toggle=\"collapse\"> Disclaimer <\/a>\r\n<div id=\"collapse125\" class=\"collapse\">\r\n<div class=\"card card-body\"><small>Gambling problem?

He got hit hard early, but now I see him being confident to bounce back. He has also been consistent all year and even better at home. He\u2019s recorded 57 strikeouts at home and 5 in his last two starts. But, in those two starts, he only pitched a combined 7.2 innings. I see him pitching deeper into this game and stacking the K\u2019s in this one. Take Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='dane-dunning-over-3-5-strikeouts-130'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><b>Dane Dunning Over 3.5 Strikeouts (-130)<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1048\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will be taking Dane Dunning to show up on the road against the Padres. He has recorded four or more strikeouts in four of his last five games, and I also expect him to be motivated in this start. He\u2019s been great all season, as he is (8-3) on the year, and he has a 3.18 ERA. The Padres have a solid lineup, but I also see them having a lot of strikeout potential. They have big hitters, but if they aren\u2019t hot, then they could struggle. That\u2019s exactly what I see happening, as I expect Dunning to dominate in this one. Take the over 3.5 Strikeouts and expect a solid performance.<\/span> \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id='zack-wheeler-over-6-5-strikeouts-160'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><b>Zack Wheeler Over 6.5 Strikeouts (-160)<\/b><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Wheeler might\u2019ve had a slow start to the year, but he has really turned it on as of late. He has recorded seven strikeouts in six of his last seven games, and I really like his matchup in this one. The Pirates have not been spectacular since the break, and they are (4-6) in their last 10. Pittsburgh is also only hitting .232 as a team this season, as I expect them to struggle in this one. Wheeler will come out aggressive and record enough strikeouts to push his total over 6.5.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 id='total-parlay-odds-+427-on-draft-kings'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Total Parlay Odds: +427 on Draft Kings<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of the players that I have listed above have proven that they can get the job throughout their careers and this season. Today, they have solid matchups, and they\u2019ve been waiting to explode on the mound. So, let\u2019s start the weekend with a little extra cash in our pockets. Parlay these three consistent beasts and get ready to meet us at the window. It\u2019s a BIG Friday and we are looking to strike out the books! Parlays were never meant to be easy, but I believe we\u2019ve done enough research to get the job done.
