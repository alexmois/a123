I want to find teams that have continued to strike out consistently this season. Now, I have found three separate areas that I would like to attack, as I EXPECT to cash in BIG today! It doesn\u2019t matter if you think a team is going to win or lose,  you just have to find one perfect spot. Luckily, I have done that for everyone today! It\u2019s never going to be easy, but once you find success with these props, you won\u2019t look back! Hop on this MLB 3-Leg Player Prop Parlay, and you won\u2019t regret it!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/online-sports-betting\/how-to-make-parlaying-player-props-work-for-you-945\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Make Player Props Work for You!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='dean-kremer-over-5-5-strikeouts-150'  id=\"boomdevs_1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dean Kremer Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-150)<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will be riding with the Orioles starting pitcher today, as I believe he has a great matchup. He will be facing the Twins, who are averaging the 30th least amount of K\u2019s per game. 10.29 strikeouts per game to be exact, as I see him starting this game hot and pitching deep enough into this game to push this strikeout total over the number. Kremer has also recorded at least five strikeouts in seven straight games. He will continue to attack in this one and record more than (5.5) strikeouts.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='jose-berrios-over-4-5-strikeouts-160'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jose Berrios Over 4.5 Strikeouts (-160)&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also really like Jose Berrios matchup in this game, as the Red Sox have struggled against RHP in their last five games. In that stretch, they are only hitting .221 vs. RHP and striking out 8.2 times per game. Berrios has been a beast at home as of late and I expect him to show up in this game. He is currently (8-5), but he is (4-1) at home and his ERA drops to 2.48. He has also recorded at least five strikeouts in six of his last eight starts. He\u2019s been playing great and I see him staying hot in this game. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick Jose Berrios to record Over (4.5) strikeouts.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"py-3 border mb-3 d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full mr-3\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/draftkings-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" \/>\n<h4 id='acf-field=-draftkings-generic-promo-text-post-id=-options'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"mb-0 pb-0\" >Bet $5 Get $200 Instantly + Up to $150 in No Sweat Bets<\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-12 col-md-6\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-block\" role=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/dksb.sng.link\/As9kz\/tnvk?_dl=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;_fallback_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;pcid=274670&amp;psn=2049&amp;pcn=xx&amp;pscn=Bet5&amp;pcrn=WinnersandWhiners&amp;pscid=Toplist&amp;pcrid=xx&amp;_ios_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;_android_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grab the Offer Now!<\/a>\n<div class=\"col-12 px-1\"><a role=\"button\" href=\"#collapse125\" data-toggle=\"collapse\"> Disclaimer <\/a>\n<div id=\"collapse125\" class=\"collapse\">\n<div class=\"card card-body\"><small>Gambling problem?

San Francisco is striking out the 28th least amount of times per game and Carrasco has recorded at least five of his last six starts. He hasn\u2019t pitched particularly deep into games, but I think he has a chance to show up at home in this game. The Giants have also been better against LHP, as they are only hitting .241 as a team in their last 10 games against a RHP. They will struggle at different points in this one and Carrasco will record just enough Ks to push this total over the number (4.5).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parlay Odds: +379\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Betting on player props in any sport is a tough task.
