The weekend is finally here and I am looking to pay for all of your drinks tonight. But, first we are going to look at three pitchers that have great matchups and they\u2019ve been putting up STELLAR numbers all season long. So, ride with me today! Hop on these three MLB Player Props and get ready to land back in the GREEN!<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id='bet-$50-and-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-when-you-sign-up-with-caesar-sportsbook-and-use-promo-code-wawmetaget'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" >Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when you sign up with <a href=\"https:\/\/wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com\/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=\">Caesar Sportsbook<\/a> and USE Promo Code: WAWMETAGET\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b>21+ Terms and conditions apply.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3 id=''  id=\"boomdevs_3\" ><\/h3>\n<h3 id=\"boomdevs_4\"><b>Tanner Bibee Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love this spot for Bibee on the road, as he is 9-3 on the season with a 3.01 ERA. He has consistently got the job done for his team all season long and he pitched great against this same Blue Jays team just three starts back. He pitched for seven innings and only allowed two earned runs, as I see him putting up similar numbers in this game. He will stay out of trouble for the majority of the game, as I expect him to pitch at least six innings. Toronto hasn\u2019t been going crazy at the plate and I don\u2019t see them lighting up Bibee early. Take him to record more than 17.5 Outs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id='dylan-cease-over-17-5-outs-recorded-145'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" ><b>Dylan Cease Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-145)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also really like this spot at home for Dylan Cease. The White Sox fell to the A\u2019s yesterday and they are going to be highly motivated to bounce back in this game. Cease is arguably their best pitcher and he should be ready to bounce back in this game. He struggled against the Rockies in his last start, but now he is facing one of the worst offenses in the league. Oakland is averaging the least amount of runs per game and they are only 3-7 in their last 10. They will struggle in this game and Cease will pitch consistently throughout. Take Dylan Cease to record more than 17.5 Outs with the second pick of our parlay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id='spencer-strider-over-8-5-strikeouts-135'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" ><b>Spencer Strider Over 8.5 Strikeouts (-135)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love this spot for the Braves and Strider. The Giants have continued to strike out all season and they haven\u2019t overly impressed me as of late. They are 3-7 in their last 10 games played and they are averaging the fourth most strikeouts per game in the MLB. They are averaging 9.42 strikeouts per game, as this is a perfect spot for Strider at home. He actually faced this same exact Giants team in his last start, as well. In that game, he recorded 10 strikeouts, pitched for 7 innings, and only allowed 1 hit. He has the Giants number and I expect him to stay hot in this game. Take Spencer Strider to record more than 8.5 Strikeouts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"boomdevs_7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parlay Odds: +411<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling all NFL fans!
