To maximize your winnings, the best route is to place exotic bets such as trifectas and superfectas. These wagers have the potential to generate the highest payout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='recent-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id=\"boomdevs_1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Recent Kentucky Derby Payouts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h5 id='2020-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >2020 Kentucky Derby Payouts<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$2 Trifecta: $2,623.60<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>$2 Superfecta: $15,851.60<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 id='2021-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >2021 Kentucky Derby Payouts<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$2 Trifecta: $3,393.80<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>$2 Superfecta: $18,912.80<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 id='2022-kentucky-derby-payouts'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >2022 Kentucky Derby Payouts<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$2 Trifecta: $29,741.40<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>$2 Superfecta: $64,300.20<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to get to it? Here\u2019s a brief breakdown of who we like and why. Below is the breakdown of exactly how to construct each ticket.&nbsp;<b><strong>Newbies welcome!<\/strong><\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b><strong>Two Phils<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;is a horse we expect to be in the money at the Derby, thanks to its strong closing speed. Currently, at 12-1 odds, a win would yield a sizable payout.&nbsp;<b><strong>Two Phils<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;has three starts this season, finishing in the money in each race with one win, one second, and one 3rd place. In its eight career starts, it has won four times and placed second and third once each. Jockey Jareth Loveberry has been in the money on 43% of his mounts this season, with 35 first-place finishes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up I like&nbsp;<b><strong>Mage<\/strong><\/b>, currently projected at 15-1.&nbsp;<b><strong>Mage<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;is trained by Gustavo Delgado, and&nbsp; has been in the money in two of his three starts, including a game second (after a bad break) to Forte in the Florida Derby., He&#8217;ll be ridden by Jockey Javier Castellano.&nbsp;<b><strong>Mage<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;is lightly raced, but it is beautifully bred (Good Magic and a Big Brown mare), so he&#8217;ll have no trouble with the Derby distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, we favor&nbsp;<b><strong>Hit Show,<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;another long shot at 30-1 odds. Trained by Brad Cox and ridden by the in-form jockey Manny Franco, Hit Show has demonstrated a knack for closing the gap late in races. This year, the horse has been in the money in two out of three races, with one win and one 2nd place. In its career,&nbsp;<b><strong>Hit Show<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;has been in the money in four of its five starts, with four wins. Jockey Franco has been in the money in 57% of his mounts this year, including 93 victories. We\u2019re also using&nbsp;<b><strong>Derma Sotogake<\/strong><\/b>&nbsp;at 40-1 odds in there too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can opt for the safe bet with the favorite,&nbsp;<b><strong>Forte<\/strong><\/b>, a modest wager on these three horses could yield significant returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='how-i-would-allocate-a-$200-bet-to-make-5-figures-in-the-kentucky-derby'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >How I would Allocate a $200 Bet to make 5-figures in the Kentucky Derby<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, here&#8217;s a breakdown of how I would allocate a $200 bet in the race to swing for the fences. Like, 5-figures!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to wager only $100, simply reduce each amount by 50%, and adjust accordingly for other amounts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>$1 Superfecta Box:<\/strong> Two Phils\/Mage\/Hit Show\/Forte\/Derma Sotogake= $120<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>$1 Trifecta Box:<\/strong> Two Phils\/Mage\/Hit Show\/Forte\/Derma Sotogake=$60<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>$1 Exacta Box:<\/strong> Two Phils\/Mage\/Hit Show\/Forte\/Derma Sotogake=$20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are two racebooks offering generous sign-up bonuses, which you could use to potentially increase your winnings. I\u2019ve outlined some strategies for leveraging those bonuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b><strong><u>Option #1<\/u><\/strong><\/b>: Leverage<b><strong>&nbsp;AmWager\u2019s&nbsp;<\/strong><\/b>100% deposit match.
