Check out our Experts and earn a huge profit!<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Several NFL bettors will not bet on preseason games, with one of the biggest reasons being that the same methods of handicapping that are used in regular-season games do not work when it comes to NFL preseason games. Although it requires a different mindset, sports bettors can still win big in the NFL preseason, and the sportsbooks hold less of an advantage than it does during the regular season.<\/p>\n<h3 id='breaking-venmo-now-accepted-at-caesars-grab-your-bet-credits-of-up-to-$1250-today-click-for-full-details'  id=\"boomdevs_4\" ><a class=\"text-info bubble-click\" href=\"https:\/\/l.wwsbn.com\/caesar-venmo-top\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-cat=\"top-of-page-alert\" data-action=\"click\" data-label=\"Caesars Venmo Article\">Breaking: Venmo now accepted at Caesars!

Click for Full Details.<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The most significant difference between a preseason and regular season game is evident as most NFL coaches do not have a final goal of winning each preseason game but getting the team prepared for winning during the regular season. Coaches are looking to fill empty spots on each side of the line of scrimmage and are looking for one to two backup players in each position on both offense and defense. During the preseason, several players will see action that may never play a down during the regular season.<\/p>\n<p>One big thing to remember when betting on the NFL preseason is the movement of the lines. Oddsmakers often will get the lines incorrect during the preseason, with several point spreads set near \u201cthree\u201d as the sportsbooks are not really aware of how much playing time first-teamers will receive and how well the team\u2019s backups will perform.<\/p>\n<p>There are several new faces on each roster, including rookies, players received in trades, and players signed through free agency. In addition, some players will hold out for a better contract or are held out for caution of injuries.<\/p>\n<h3 id='why-we-think-draftkings-is-the-best-sportsbook-for-player-props-read-more'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/winnersandwhiners.com\/betting\/draftkings-is-the-premier-spot-for-player-props-940\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"940\">Why we think DraftKings is the best sportsbook for Player Props \u2013 Read More.<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most important factors, if you are going to bet on the NFL preseason, is gathering as much information on potential game plans, playing time for top players, and any motivational situation that could cause a team to play better or worse than is expected. Often, a team will have one or two players battling for a top defensive spot or an offensive spot, and that will create stronger play from that side of the ball and could influence the outcome of the game.<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to know that several NFL coaches love to win preseason games, such as John Harbaugh from the Baltimore Ravens and Pete Carroll for Seattle, amongst others. Baltimore has won an NFL record 23 consecutive preseason games and is an impressive 20-3 against the spread over that span.<\/p>\n<p>Quarterback rotations are also important to consider when betting on the preseason, as two things could take place. If the No. 1 position is already known, there will be a fight for the backup position which means possibly more passing and possible touchdowns. The second option is the starting quarterback position is still unknown and will create even more battles between two to three potential starters under center.<\/p>\n<p>Another one of my NFL Preseason betting tips to always remember is that the numbers \u201cone\u201d and \u201ctwo\u201d are key numbers in NFL preseason betting odds. Unlike the regular season, teams will go for a victory at the end of regulation in the preseason rather than playing for a tie because there is no overtime in the preseason. If a team trails by seven points and scores to remain one point behind, rather than kick the extra point and tie, they will likely go for a two-point conversion, which brings short spreads of one and two points into play.<\/p>\n<h3 id='every-point-matters-in-the-nfl-so-you-want-to-have-access-to-multiple-sportsbooks-take-advantage-of-the-limited-time-first-time-deposit-bonuses-here'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/winnersandwhiners.com\/betting\">Every point matters in the NFL, so you want to have access to multiple sportsbooks.
