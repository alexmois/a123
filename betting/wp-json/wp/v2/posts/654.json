It is the oldest of the three races of the Triple Crown but not the most famous. The race predates the Preakness by six years and the Kentucky Derby by eight years. Unlike the other two races, however, the venue for the Belmont Stakes has changed frequently over the years as well as the length of the race. The race\u2019s primary home has been Belmont Park since 1905 and it has been run at a mile and a half since 1926.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have only been 13 Triple Crown winners ever with the last being Justify in 2018. Since 1978, there have only been three Triple Crown winners despite eight horses arriving at Belmont Park to take their shot at immortality. Many horses have fallen victim to the demands of such a long race with so much on the line. It is why the race has been dubbed \u2018The Test of a Champion\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id='belmont-stakes-five-fastest-finish-times'  id=\"boomdevs_1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" >Belmont Stakes Five Fastest Finish Times<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the five fastest times in the storied history of the Belmont Stakes<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id='5-point-given-2021'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" class=\"wp-block-heading mb-0\" >#5 &#8211; Point Given, 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, Point Given won the Belmont with a time of 2:26.56 to claim the final two legs of the Triple Crown after being upset at the Kentucky Derby.
