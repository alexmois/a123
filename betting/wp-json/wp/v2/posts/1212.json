Last season, each of the four teams in the division finished in the bottom five in the NFL in yards per play allowed defensively. With Aaron Rodgers now in New York, the Lions are favored to win their first division title since 1993.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are my OVER\/UNDER win total betting predictions for the NFC North with odds provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com\/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077\">Caesars Sportsbook<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id='4th-green-bay-packers-under-7-5-+120'  id=\"boomdevs_2\" ><b>4TH: Green Bay Packers UNDER 7.5 (+120)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Predicted Record 7-10<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Packers have a demanding schedule this season. Amongst the most significant challenges are road games against the Falcons, Broncos, Steelers, and Giants and home games against the Chargers and Chiefs. It will be challenging for the Packers to win more than one of those games. Whether or not Jordan Love will have this offense ready to keep up with his counterparts in the North is a big question, and considering that this team only went 8-9 with Aaron Rodgers last season, the under is the way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id='why-go-halfway-when-you-can-go-full-caesar-snag-up-to-$1-250-in-bet-credit-if-your-first-bet-doesn-t-win'  id=\"boomdevs_3\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why go halfway when you can go <a href=\"https:\/\/mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com\/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077\">FULL CAESAR?<\/a>\u00a0Snag up to $1,250 in bet credit if your first bet doesn&#8217;t win.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:<\/span> <b>21+.

Road games at Atlanta and Denver will also be tough later on. Minnesota&#8217;s last four games on the schedule include a trip to Cincinnati and two games against the Lions. Almost everything went right for the Vikings last season, but I see regression in 2023. The under is the play here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id='2nd-chicago-bears-over-7-5-140'  id=\"boomdevs_5\" ><b>2ND: Chicago Bears OVER 7.5 (-140)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Predicted record: 9-8<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bears went 3-14 last season and ended the season on a 10-game losing streak. Despite their poor record, they went 1-7 in games decided by seven points or less. This group will take a step forward in 2023. If they can win three divisional games, they\u2019ll be in good shape to reach eight wins. Their schedule includes home games against the Raiders, Panthers, Cardinals, and Falcons and early season road games against the Buccaneers and Commanders. The Bears could be a sleeper to win the division, but there is still substantial room for improvement. Chicago&#8217;s defensive pass rush was dead last in the NFL in sacks last season which had a lot to do with the horrendous record. On the offensive side of the ball, the line was upgraded in the offseason, and with Justin Fields expected to take another step forward, I like the Bears to get to eight wins or more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id='1st-detroit-lions-under-9-5-+105'  id=\"boomdevs_6\" ><b>1ST: Detroit Lions UNDER 9.5 (+105)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Predicted record: 9-8<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lions were a feel-good story last season, winning six games as an underdog and barely missing the playoffs. Although the defense should be better, I&#8217;m not ready to pencil the offense in as one of the top four in the NFL again. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the Lions have yet to win more than nine games since 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t see the Lions cruising through the NFC North and outside the division, and this group will have a hard time catching teams by surprise. The schedule has brutal matchups, including road games against the Chiefs, Ravens, Chargers, Saints, and Cowboys. I see the Lions winning eight or nine games in 2023, but not 10 or more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1216\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.winnersandwhiners.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/USATSI_19562391_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 id='division-winner-detroit-lions-+120'  id=\"boomdevs_7\" ><b>Division Winner: Detroit Lions +120<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I took the Lions to fall short of 9.5 wins, they are the best bet to win the North. Although the Lions won\u2019t catch teams by surprise this season, the defense should be better, and they still have a higher floor than any other team in the division.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id='if-you-are-looking-to-build-your-nfl-ncaa-football-or-mlb-bankroll-with-david-delano-or-any-of-our-other-handicappers-this-season-it-s-simple'  id=\"boomdevs_8\" ><b>If you are looking to build your NFL, NCAA Football, or MLB bankroll with David Delano or any of our other handicappers this season, it\u2019s simple.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Get in the game with <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com\/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077\">Caesars Sportsbook<\/a> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/experts.winnersandwhiners.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check out the best bets each day from the Winners and Whiners experts!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, don&#8217;t forget to shop your lines.
