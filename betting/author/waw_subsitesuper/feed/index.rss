<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this huge matchup being played on Saturday, it is also a great time to look at the from Winners and Whiners writer <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/nfl/9-10-2023/miami-dolphins-vs-los-angeles-chargers-prediction-6643/">Eric Ploch</a></span> on a very serious, and overlooked story in the sports betting community.</p>
<h2 id='the-lessons-learned-from-iowa-student-betting-issues'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lessons Learned from Iowa student Betting Issues </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the college football season quickly approaching with the rise of online betting across the country, a concerning issue in the state of Iowa has fans thinking what their favorite teams or players might be up to. Between Iowa and Iowa State, 15 total athletes, in addition to two student managers, have been charged with misdemeanors in relation to illegal sports gambling and records tampering, according to KCCI. Once seen as a forbidden space in college athletics, it has raised questions as to where else this happening, as well as how often.</span></p>
<h2 id='caesars-sportsbook-promo-code-wawmetaget-bet-$50-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-for-any-sport'  id="boomdevs_3" ><b>Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code WAWMETAGET – Bet $50, Get $250 in Bonus Bets for any sport!</b></h2>
<p><b>To Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets deal  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </b><a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c="><b>here</b></a><b> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b05.png" alt="⬅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Iowa State, it was shocking to see their starting quarterback involved, Hunter Dekkers, who placed 366 wagers since joining the Cyclones, including on a game involving his own team. One of the most stunning bets was from Iowa football player, Aaron Blom, who allegedly placed a bet on the under in a game involving his own team, again, according to KCCI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Hawkeyes and Cyclones, questions remain as to the consequences of these actions, with Iowa State Athletic Director Jamie Pollard saying in the summer, &#8220;Iowa State cannot comment on any student-athletes’ circumstance or eligibility status. We will, however, continue to support our student-athletes as our compliance staff works with the NCAA to sort out questions surrounding their future eligibility for intercollegiate athletics competition.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting#collapseCaesars"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other schools will certainly be looking to do more diligence on the actions of their student-athletes as well, to avoid these issues in the future, especially as gambling continues to grow. It wouldn’t come as a surprise to see schools start to monitor the phones of their student-athletes or block certain sites within athletic facilities, while increased training and education is top of mind. While only a handful have been found to have done this, there’s little doubt that across the country, this is likely becoming a widespread problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of student-athletes having a stake in things or having a leg up when it comes to information or a gameplan, would skew the lines. At what point does a player take a knee or run up the score, as fans wonder if there was an ulterior motive? It will be a challenge for athletic directors to grab hold of this situation, though with all the money involved in college athletics and gambling, this is an issue that needs to find its way to the forefront. Add in the potential embarrassment of those players involved and it’ll be interesting to see how this story progresses, not only in Iowa, but across the country.</span></p>
<p><b>College Football Expert Chris King has a full breakdown with his side and total predictions for the huge matchup between Iowa at Iowa State for this Saturday.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa vs Iowa State</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday, September 9, 2023</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds at <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesars Sportsbook</a> Iowa -3.5 OU 36.5</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris states: It&#8217;s safe to say that neither team was overly impressive on the offensive side of the ball in their respective openers. With that said, at least Iowa has their starting quarterback and a few playmakers on that side of the ball. McNamara transferred from Michigan to take over the starting job with the Hawkeyes and he was solid, though unspectacular, in his team debut. Iowa State failed to impress as they failed to score over the final 28 minutes against Northern Iowa. Without Dekkers or last year’s leading rusher, Jirehl Brock, who left the team as part of the investigation, there’s not a ton to get excited about with the Cyclones. Take Iowa in what should be a rock fight as they reclaim the Cy-Hawk Trophy.</span></p>

<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-5-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_3" >Andrew Abbott Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</h3>
<p>I will be hammering Abbott’s strikeout prop in this one, as he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in five straight games and the Cardinals have continued to struggle on the road this season. They haven’t been extremely hot at the plate over their last three games either. They averaged 9.67 Ks per game in their last 3, as I see them struggling again in this one. Abbott has been solid all season and he’s going to show up in this one.</p>
<p>Take him to record Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</p>

<p>This is a MASSIVE game for the Rays and I expect Bradley to pitch deep into this game. He has also recorded at least 15 outs in four of his last five starts. He also picked up a win in his last start, as I see him picking up steam and starting to roll. It isn’t like Seattle has been this offensive powerhouse this season either. They only have the 19th highest team batting average, as I believe this game will be low scoring and tight.</p>
<p>Bradley will hang around and pitch long enough to record more than 14.5 Outs.</p>

<p>I love this spot for Kikuchi, as I have been backing him a lot lately. He is 9-5 on the season and he only has a 3.63 ERA, as this Royals batting lineup doesn’t stand a chance. They have cooled down over the last two weeks and they still have one of the worst records in baseball. Yusei has also pitched for at least six innings in four of his last six starts. He’s been a reliable starter for the Blue Jays for the last month and a half and I expect him to dominate a poor Kansas City team in this one.</p>
<p>Take Kikuchi to record more than 15.5 Outs (-125).</p>
<h3 id='parlay-odds-+359'  id="boomdevs_7" >Parlay Odds: +359</h3>
<p>Yes, these picks might look a little bit safer today, but I promise you this is a great strategy when<br />
setting up your parlays. If you can find three “Favorites” that you believe have a serious<br />
advantage, then parlay them together, and let it rip! That’s exactly what I am doing today and I expect to CASH IN BIG! So, strap in tight and get ready to ride! Let’s have a FANTASTIC<br />
Friday!</p>

<h3 id='sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_1" id="sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel" ><strong>SEC Champion Prediction: LSU Tigers (+460) @ <a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p>As has been the case for several seasons, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is loaded with talented teams in both the East and West divisions. The defending National Champion Georgia Bulldogs (-110) will win the East Division. I then expect Georgia to face the LSU Tigers (+450) in the conference Championship game, with the Tigers prevailing.</p>
<div id="attachment_1313" class="wp-caption alignright"></div>
<p>LSU Quarterback Jayden Daniels will begin his second season under head coach Brian Kelly, and the offensive line should be much stronger than last season. The Tigers’ receiving corps, led by Malik Nabers (wide receiver) and Mason Taylor (tight end ), is one of the conference’s best. LSU has to play Alabama (+240) on the road, but the Tigers will prevail and win the division.</p>

<p>The LSU defense gave up just 22.5 points per game last season and this season is even stronger upfront as Mason Smith is back following a knee injury that left him sidelined for most of the season last year. Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU’s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id='kentucky-wildcats-over-7'  id="boomdevs_4" id="kentucky-wildcats-over-7" ><strong>Kentucky Wildcats over 7 </strong></h3>
<p>Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility.</p>

<h3 id='texas-a-m-aggies-over-8'  id="boomdevs_7" id="texas-a-m-aggies-over-8" ><strong>Texas A&amp;M Aggies over 8 </strong></h3>
<p>Texas A&amp;M was one of the nation’s biggest underachievers in 2022 and still has question marks for this season but with coach Bobby Petrino in charge of play calling for head coach Jimbo Fisher, optimism reigns on the offense under quarterback Connor Weigman and wide receiver Evan Stewart. The Texas A&amp;M defense was young and highly talented last season and will improve with experience. If the offense is able to improve, expect to see the Aggies win at least eight games.</p>

<h3 id='alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5'  id="boomdevs_8" id="alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5" ><strong>Alabama Crimson Tide Under 10.5 </strong></h3>
<p>Alabama will once again be a highly talented football team in 2023 but the quarterback position remains unsettled. Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.</p>
<p>The coaching staff is solid but after losing Bryce Young to the NFL, Alabama has a three-man battle for the starting QB with Jalen Milroe, last season’s backup, the front runner. Alabama punched the over ticket last season, while finishing 4th overall in total offense but will not have the talent this season on that side of the ball as they did last year. The defense was 9th overall last season in points allowed but gave up 84 points in their two losses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='sleeper-tennessee-volunteers-+1-500-to-win-sec-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_9" id="sleeper-tennessee-volunteers-+1-500-to-win-sec-fanduel" ><strong>Sleeper: Tennessee Volunteers +1,500 to win SEC @<a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game. Quarterback Joe Milton takes the reins this season in Knoxville, and the Volunteers will have each of their top three running backs returning, including Jabari Small, Jaylen Wright, and Dylan Sampson, who combined to rush for 5.6 yards per carry with 29 touchdowns on the ground. Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.</p>

<p>Big 12 Football is headed for a transition year, with Texas and Oklahoma set to depart for the SEC in 2024. The two heavyweights will take with them much of the league’s luster and history, but there is still optimism for the conference’s immediate and long-term prospects.</p>
<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone " src="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/betmgm-logo.png" alt="" width="304" height="101" /></a></div>

</div>
<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" role="button" href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claim Offer</a></div>

<p>This season, the Big 12 will welcome BYU, UCF, Cincinnati, and Houston, giving the league an intriguing mix of established programs and up-and-comers. The conference will expand further next year, too, with Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah set to join.</p>
<p>The new blood will garner the early-season headlines, but it won’t be all she wrote about the 2023 Big 12 football season. On the heels of TCU’s national championship appearance, the conference appears poised to crash the College Football Playoff again. While this year will be the final under the four-team format, there’s optimism on more than one Big 12 campus that this is “their year.”</p>
<h2 id='conference-champion-prediction-texas-longhorns-+115'  id="boomdevs_2" ><strong>Conference Champion Prediction: Texas Longhorns +115 </strong></h2>
<p>I’m bullish on the Longhorns to rise to the occasion in 2023, bidding farewell to the Big 12 with the conference championship trophy on their shoulders, their first since 2009. Texas features a rising star at quarterback in Quinn Ewers, an All-American receiver in Xavier Worthy, and five returning starters along the offensive line. The defense made significant strides last year and returns six starters, including 73 percent of passes defended.</p>
<h1 id='betmgm-bonus-code-whiners-get-$1-500-first-bet-offer-for-college-football-week-1'  id="boomdevs_3" id="betmgm-bonus-code-whiners-get-$1-500-first-bet-offer-for-tuesday" ><a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077">BetMGM</a> Bonus Code WHINERS- Get $1,500 First Bet Offer for College Football Week 1</h1>
<p>The schedule also works in the Longhorns’ favor. UT plays just five true road games and four of the projected bottom five Big 12 teams. Aside from Alabama, there’s no team on its schedule that has more collective talent. It will be at least a four-point favorite in the rest of its games and the best bet to win the conference title at +115 odds.</p>
<h2 id='best-bet-over-under-win-totals'  id="boomdevs_4" ><strong>Best Bet Over/Under Win Totals</strong></h2>
<h3 id='central-florida-over-7-0-wins'  id="boomdevs_5" ><strong>Central Florida: Over 7.0 Wins</strong></h3>
<p>The Knights are the newcomer best prepared to win this season, as they return a two-year starter at QB in John Rhys Plumlee and a seasoned head coach in Gus Malzahn who has brought in a slew of talented players via the transfer portal. There are a few challenges in the first half of the season, including road games at Boise State, Kansas State, and Oklahoma, but there will be opportunities to reach the eight-win mark down the stretch.</p>
<h3 id='kansas-state-over-8-0-wins'  id="boomdevs_6" ><strong>Kansas State: Over 8.0 Wins</strong></h3>
<p>The Wildcats are going to surprise a few people this season, even after surpassing Vegas’ expectations for them last year. KSU returns rising star QB Will Howard, an established group of offensive linemen, and several talented running backs who will offset the loss of Deuce Vaughn. The defense has some holes, particularly in the secondary, but the Cats’ schedule looks favorable, with TCU, Baylor, UCF, and Iowa State all traveling to Manhattan this season.</p>
<h3 id='oklahoma-under-9-5-wins'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>Oklahoma: Under 9.5 Wins</strong></h3>
<p>The Sooners’ final season in the Big 12 will prove to be a letdown. As a bettor, there are too many question marks about this team to realistically predict ten wins. OU lost most of its playmakers from last season and returns a defense that gave up 6.04 yards per snap in conference play, ranking 122nd nationally in total defense. It might have been unlucky in 2022, losing all five of its one-score games, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will win all of its close contests this year. There are winnable games early in the season, but the back half of the schedule looks arduous. Like Texas, Oklahoma will have a target on its back, especially against the conference’s newcomers. Unlike its rival, it doesn’t appear poised to handle that type of pressure.</p>
<h3 id='big-12-sleeper-squad-kansas-jayhawks'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Big 12 Sleeper Squad: Kansas Jayhawks</strong></h3>
<p>My sleeper team for the 2023 season is Kansas. The Jayhawks return 17 starters, and after taking a significant stride forward in 2022, look capable of taking another leap this year. QB Jalon Daniels leads a talented Jayhawks offense suited for the conference’s style of play. His heroics will catch at least a couple of teams by surprise, generating palpable buzz for a program that was starving for wins just a couple of seasons ago. There is plenty of skepticism about the defense after KU surrendered 35.5 PPG last year, but I’m confident the chip on its shoulder will inspire it to make a few more impactful plays in 2023.</p>

<p>Florida sports betting has been in the news after being halted and kept in limbo for almost 2 years before the DC Court of Appeals on June 30th overturned a district court decision blocking sports betting in the Sunshine State. However, on August 14th, a petition was filed for a rehearing to block the launch. Nonetheless, a chance remains that sports betting in Florida will be relaunched prior to the NFL kickoff on September 7th.</p>

<p>Florida is the third most populous state in the United States with close to 22 million people and sports fans across the state are eagerly awaiting positive news on Sports gambling. If sports betting online in Florida returns there are multiple ways in which sports bettors in the state can place a wager on their favorite team or player.</p>
<p>Most states held discussions in public legislative hearings, while Florida&#8217;s discussions were almost entirely behind closed doors. Any sports betting deal in Florida required long-term negotiating between the Seminole tribe and the state.</p>
<h4 id='as-of-august-22nd-it-was-announced-that-the-launch-of-florida-s-hard-rock-bet-in-time-for-the-start-of-the-nfl-season-on-september-7th-was-once-again-in-doubt-because-of-a-district-court-of-appeals-request-regarding-a-petition-filed-by-west-flagler-associates'  id="boomdevs_2" >As of August 22nd, it was announced that the launch of Florida&#8217;s Hard Rock Bet in time for the start of the NFL season on September 7th was once again in doubt because of a district court of appeals request regarding a petition filed by West Flagler Associates.</h4>
<p>Two weeks ago, Charles Upton, who became the chairperson of the Florida Gaming Control Commission less than 5 months ago, resigned. This mark&#8217;s the third time in less than 2 years the position is vacant.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bet’s app is not available in Florida because of the latest legal procedures taking place. Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida, which is operated by the Seminole Tribe, is the most recognized brand. The Seminole tribe enjoys exclusivity in Florida when it comes to sports betting and therefore Hard Rock Bet was the foremost amongst the options presented.</p>
<h2 id='how-will-your-favorite-florida-team-fare-in-week-1'  id="boomdevs_3" >How will your favorite Florida team fare in Week 1?</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal between the Seminole Tribe and the Florida state government allows for other Sportsbook brands in Florida to participate. However, the trick is that those brands must enter into a deal with the Tribe in order to receive access to the sports betting market in Florida.</p>
<h4 id='for-example-if-betmgm-or-draftkings-wanted-to-offer-its-members-sports-betting-across-florida-with-a-mobile-app-the-companies-would-have-to-agree-to-pay-the-seminole-tribe-a-percentage-of-the-revenue-earned-by-the-sportsbook-in-exchange-for-operating-within-florida'  id="boomdevs_4" >For example, if <a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1694077">BetMGM</a> or <a href="https://dksb.sng.link/As9kz/tnvk?_dl=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;_fallback_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;pcid=274670&amp;psn=2049&amp;pcn=xx&amp;pscn=Bet5&amp;pcrn=WinnersandWhiners&amp;pscid=Toplist&amp;pcrid=xx&amp;_ios_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx&amp;_android_redirect=https%3a%2f%2fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2fgateway%3fs%3d807135859%26wpcid%3d274670%26wpsrc%3d2049%26wpcn%3dxx%26wpscn%3dBet5%26wpcrn%3dWinnersandWhiners+%26wpscid%3dToplist%26wpcrid%3dxx">DraftKings</a> wanted to offer its members sports betting across Florida with a mobile app, the companies would have to agree to pay the Seminole Tribe a percentage of the revenue earned by the sportsbook in exchange for operating within Florida.</h4>
<p>As of August 29, the availability of sports betting across the State of Florida was still up in the air and the countdown has started as the NFL regular season kicks off on September 7th and since NFL betting is the most popular amongst sports bettors, sportsbooks are at risk of losing large sums of money if they cannot launch in time for the opening kickoff.</p>

<h3 id='sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_3" ><strong>SEC Champion Prediction: LSU Tigers (+460) @ <a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As has been the case for several seasons, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is loaded with talented teams in both the East and West divisions. The defending National Champion Georgia Bulldogs (-110) will win the East Division. I then expect Georgia to face the LSU Tigers (+450) in the conference Championship game, with the Tigers prevailing.  </span></p>

Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LSU Quarterback Jayden Daniels will begin his second season under head coach Brian Kelly, and the offensive line should be much stronger than last season. The Tigers’ receiving corps, led by Malik Nabers (wide receiver) and Mason Taylor (tight end ), is one of the conference’s best. LSU has to play Alabama (+240) on the road, but the Tigers will prevail and win the division.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LSU defense gave up just 22.5 points per game last season and this season is even stronger upfront as Maason Smith is back following a knee injury that left him sidelined for most of the season last year. Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU&#8217;s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility. </span></p>

<h3 id='texas-a-m-aggies-over-8'  id="boomdevs_7" ><strong>Texas A&amp;M Aggies over 8 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M was one of the nation&#8217;s biggest underachievers in 2022 and still has question marks for this season but with coach Bobby Petrino in charge of play calling for head coach Jimbo Fisher, optimism reigns on the offense under quarterback Connor Weigman and wide receiver Evan Stewart. The Texas A&amp;M defense was young and highly talented last season and will improve with experience. If the offense is able to improve, expect to see the Aggies win at least eight games. </span></p>

<h3 id='alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5'  id="boomdevs_8" ><strong>Alabama Crimson Tide Under 10.5 </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama will once again be a highly talented football team in 2023 but the quarterback position remains unsettled. Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.  </span></p>
<h3 id="boomdevs_9"><strong><br />
Sleeper: Tennessee Volunteers +1,500 to win SEC @<a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game. Quarterback Joe Milton takes the reins this season in Knoxville, and the Volunteers will have each of their top three running backs returning, including Jabari Small, Jaylen Wright, and Dylan Sampson, who combined to rush for 5.6 yards per carry with 29 touchdowns on the ground. Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference Conference USA will look a little different this season after nine of their members over the past two seasons due to realignment. This season, the conference welcomes two former FCS teams in Jacksonville State and Sam Houston State University. They also added two FBS independents in Liberty and New Mexico State, leaving only five holdovers from last season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the addition of the new schools, only a few teams in the conference have a legitimate chance to compete for the Conference USA title this season. So, we will look at those teams and predict how many wins they will have this upcoming season with the odds according to<a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2436&amp;c="> FanDuel.</a> </span></p>

<h3 id='liberty-+125-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_4" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty +125  to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flames finished the 2022 season with an 8-5 record, which was the second-best record for Independents. During the offseason, former head coach Hugh Freeze left to coach at Auburn and the team has only eight returning starters from last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the departures from last season, there is a lot of optimism about the upcoming season. They hired 2020 AL Coach of the Year, Jamey Chadwell, who had a 35-14 record at Coastal Carolina before taking the Liberty job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty wasn’t very good offensively last season, averaging 27.7 points per game. Their passing game was 88</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country and their ground game was 51</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their offensive line should be better than it was last season after adding a few experienced transfers, led by former West Virginia offensive lineman Jordan White. They are also bringing back their top two quarterbacks from last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They lost their leading rusher Dae Dae Hunter, who entered the transfer portal, but they added Wake Forest transfer Quinton Cooley and top recruit Vaughn Blue, so don’t expect to see a drop-off in their running game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flames were very good defensively last season, giving up points per game, which was 56</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. They led the country in tackles for loss and finished third in sacks. But, they only have four of their players coming back and they tried to fix the holes left through the transfer portal, so expect to see a drop-off on that end.</span></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_5" ></h3>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-under-8-5-+134'  id="boomdevs_6" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection UNDER 8.5 (+134)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty’s win total for the season has been set at 8.5 at -164. The Flames won eight games in each of the past two seasons. Even though Chadwell had a lot of success at his last job, the Flames lost a lot of players in the offseason, so go with them to win less than 8.5 games this season.</span></p>

Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hilltoppers finished the 2022 season with a 9-5 overall record and a 6-2 record in conference play, which was good enough for third place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky had the second-best offense in the conference last season, averaging 36.4 points per game, which was 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the nation. They had a potent passing attack that averaged more than 350 yards per game, which was the second-best in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost offensive coordinator Jake Dickert, who took the head coaching job at Washington State, don’t expect to see a drop in their offensive efficiency because new offensive coordinator Drew Hollingshead, his Mississippi State team had the 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-best passing offense in the country last season and the fourth in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hilltoppers also have quarterback Austin Reed, who completed 65 percent of his passes for 4,744 yards, 40 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions last season, and leading receiver Malachi Corley, who had 101 catches for 1,293 yards and 11 touchdowns last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky’s biggest weakness going into the season is on the defensive end, with only four starters from a unit that gave up 23.5 points per game last season coming back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensive end JaQues Evans, who had 106 tackles, nine sacks, and 14 tackles for loss, will lead their young defense. The linebacker corps have a year under their belts and are expected to be better than last season, and the team added six transfers that they hope will have an immediate impact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-8-5-+110'  id="boomdevs_8" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 8.5 (+110)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Kentucky’s win total for the season has been set at 8.5 at +110. The Hilltoppers won nine games in each of the past two seasons. Their offense will be just as potent as it was last season and they shouldn’t suffer much of a drop on the defensive end. With two of the top three C-USA teams from last season playing in another conference, the Hilltoppers will win more than 8.5 games this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 id='middle-tennessee-state-+650-to-win-conference'  id="boomdevs_9" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Tennessee State +650 to win Conference </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Raiders finished the 2022 season with an 8-5 record and a 4-4 record in conference play, which was good for fourth place in the conference, and picked up a win in the Hawaii Bowl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Raiders averaged 29.5 points per game last season, which was 59</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. Their passing game was 36</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but their ground game was 114</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost their starting quarterback, Nicholas Vattiato played well in limited action, completing 65.2 percent of his passes for 293 yards and one interception. However, they lost their top three receivers, so don’t expect their passing game to be as potent as it was last season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Peasant led the team in rushing last season with 774 yards and nine touchdowns. But, he will be sharing the backfield with untested backs, so expect more of the same from their ground game this season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Blue Raiders gave up 28.1 points per game, which was 82</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. They have a good linebacker corps, but their defensive line didn’t get a lot of pressure on opposing quarterbacks and they gave up 304.7 passing yards per game last season, which was the most by a defense. But, with nine starters coming back, the unit should be better than it was last season.</span></p>
<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_10" ></h3>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-6-5-105'  id="boomdevs_11" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 6.5 (-105)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Tennessee State’s win total for this season has been set at 6.5 at -105 odds. The Blue Raiders won at least seven games in six of their last eight seasons. Their offense likely won’t be as good as it was last season, but their defense should be improved. They have three tough road games against Alabama, Missouri, and Western Kentucky on their schedule, but the rest of the schedule isn’t very tough, so expect them to win at least seven games this season.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference USA is a top-heavy conference, with Western Kentucky, Liberty, and Middle Tennessee State considered the best teams in the conference. But, the Aggies finished the 2022 season with a 7-6 record in Jerry Kill’s first year as head coach, after going 2-10 the previous season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aggies averaged 25.6 points per game last season, which was 83</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. Their passing game was 120</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while their ground game was 57</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have eight starters returning on offense, including dual-threat quarterback Diego Pavia, who completed 53.2 percent of his passes for 1,450 yards, 13 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran for 508 yards and six touchdowns. They also have their top two running backs and four of their top five receivers coming back, so expect their offense to be better than last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensively, the Aggies gave up 24.3 points per game, which was 52</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country, which was a drastic improvement from the previous season, when they had one of the worst defenses in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they lost two of their top tacklers from last season and their best defensive back, they have experienced players like Tyriece Thomas and Izaiah Reed returning, so they will be okay against the run. Their secondary will be the weak link this season, but don’t expect much of a drop-off from them defensively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='2023-win-projection-over-6-5-+134'  id="boomdevs_14" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Win Projection OVER 6.5 (+134)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico State’s win total for this season has been set at 6.5 at +134 odds. The Aggies lost their first four games last season and went 7-2 in their nine games. They will be better than they were offensively last season, but there will be a drop-off on defense. They have the second-easiest schedule, with a road trip to Auburn being their toughest test, so expect them to win more than 6.5 games this season.</span></p>

<p>by <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/2">David &#8220;The Dominator&#8221; Hess</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone following me over the years knows my team is the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, so it makes sense that I will be handling their preview this year. With six starters back on offense and eight on defense, plus the addition of QB Sam Hartman from Wake Forest, can the Irish get back in the National Title picture?  Well let’s dig in and see. </span></p>
<h2 id='caesars-sportsbook-promo-code-wawmetaget-bet-$50-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-for-the-notre-dame-vs-navy-game-this-saturday-you-can-grab-that-offer-here'  id="boomdevs_2" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code WAWMETAGET &#8211; Bet $50, Get $250 in Bonus Bets for the Notre Dame vs Navy game this Saturday! You can grab that offer <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">here</a>!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marcus Freeman Era did not get off to a good start as he lost the Bowl game in 2021 and then followed that up by going 0-2 to start last year. Their low point over that stretch was a home loss to Marshall as 20.5 point favorites, but Notre Dame did rebound to 9-2 the rest of the way. That includes a 45-38 Bowl win over South Carolina, which gives them some momentum heading into this year. </span></p>

The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish took on the University of South Carolina Gamecocks in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl game in Jacksonville, Florida&#8217;s TIAA Bank Field Friday, December 30, 2022. The first half ended with South Carolina holding a 24 to 17 lead. [Bob Self/Florida Times-Union]<br />Jki 123022 Bs Gatorbowl 36</p></div><b>The Offense:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Last year, the Irish had six starters back and they averaged just 31.8 ppg, which was 42nd in the nation. Notre Dame’s issue was inconsistent play at the QB position, but they may have rectified that problem by signing Sam Hartman from Wase Forest. Hartman has five years of experience and he threw for 12,967 yards with 110 TDs and 41 INTs in 48 games for the Demon Deacons. He will be a huge upgrade over Drew Pyne and Tyler Buchner, who split time at the QB slot for Notre Dame last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Receiving Corps is a bit thin, especially with the loss of TE Michael Mayer, who was a 2nd round-draft choice of the Raiders. Still, there are some talented receivers in this group and they have a dynamite QB that will get them the ball. Last year, the Irish were 35th in rushing, after finishing 77th the year before. Notre Dame should improve on last year’s numbers as they have back Audric Estime (920 yards, 11 TDs) and Chris Tyree (444 yards, 3 TDs) plus have added Penn State transfer Devyn Ford (667 yards the last four years). Not only does Phil Steel have Notre Dame with the 10th-best RB Corp in the nation, but he also has them with the 15th-best Offensive line as well. Getting this ground game going will only make Hartman and the passing game that much more dangerous and I can see Notre Dame easily topping 35 ppg this year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Defense:</strong> Before Marcus Freeman took over as head coach, he was the defensive coordinator for the Irish, but last year, Notre Dame did slip in this department. The Irish allowed 23 ppg last year, aver giving up no more than 19.7 ppg in their previous four years. Notre Dame allowed 329 ypg (22nd in the nation), which was actually a 31 ypg improvement over 2021, but still, the points allowed were worse. That was due to an inconsistent offense that put the defense in bad spots. We won’t see that this year with Hartman at QB and a dynamite ground attack. Notre Dame returns 8 starters, including their top four tacklers from last year and according to Phil Steele, they have the #`18 Defensive Line, #7 Linebacking Corps, and the #9 Secondary in the nation. Oh boy, this defense has a chance to be top ten in the nation. </span></p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Last year, the Irish had a solid defense, but the offense was inconsistent and that was the problem for them. Despite that, Notre Dame still had a 9-4 record overall, including a 9-2 finish. This year, they have QB Sam Hartman, a strong offensive line, and a powerful running game, which will all complement the defense nicely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/8-26-2023/navy-vs-notre-dame-prediction-4513/">Notre Dame begins with Navy</a> (Neutral Field), Tennessee State (Home), NC State (Away), and Central Michigan (Home), so they have a nice easy slate to give Hartman a chance to gel with his receiving corps. This is important as game five is at home against Ohio State. Notre Dame will also get USC at home later in the year, but they drop have a tough road game against Clemsom on November 4th. That game against Clemson could be the one that puts Notre Dame in the playoffs or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a loaded Irish team that will average 35+ ppg and allow less than 17 ppg and provided they don’t lose focus, as they did in the Marshall and Stanford games last year, Notre Dame has a bonafide shot at 11 regular season wins and a spot in the playoffs.      </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday! <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here and I am back again with another MLB Player Prop Parlay! The weekend is finally here and I am looking to pay for all of your drinks tonight. But, first we are going to look at three pitchers that have great matchups and they’ve been putting up STELLAR numbers all season long. So, ride with me today! Hop on these three MLB Player Props and get ready to land back in the GREEN!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>21+ Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" ></h3>
<h3 id="boomdevs_4"><b>Tanner Bibee Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for Bibee on the road, as he is 9-3 on the season with a 3.01 ERA. He has consistently got the job done for his team all season long and he pitched great against this same Blue Jays team just three starts back. He pitched for seven innings and only allowed two earned runs, as I see him putting up similar numbers in this game. He will stay out of trouble for the majority of the game, as I expect him to pitch at least six innings. Toronto hasn’t been going crazy at the plate and I don’t see them lighting up Bibee early. Take him to record more than 17.5 Outs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dylan-cease-over-17-5-outs-recorded-145'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Dylan Cease Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-145)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also really like this spot at home for Dylan Cease. The White Sox fell to the A’s yesterday and they are going to be highly motivated to bounce back in this game. Cease is arguably their best pitcher and he should be ready to bounce back in this game. He struggled against the Rockies in his last start, but now he is facing one of the worst offenses in the league. Oakland is averaging the least amount of runs per game and they are only 3-7 in their last 10. They will struggle in this game and Cease will pitch consistently throughout. Take Dylan Cease to record more than 17.5 Outs with the second pick of our parlay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='spencer-strider-over-8-5-strikeouts-135'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Spencer Strider Over 8.5 Strikeouts (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for the Braves and Strider. The Giants have continued to strike out all season and they haven’t overly impressed me as of late. They are 3-7 in their last 10 games played and they are averaging the fourth most strikeouts per game in the MLB. They are averaging 9.42 strikeouts per game, as this is a perfect spot for Strider at home. He actually faced this same exact Giants team in his last start, as well. In that game, he recorded 10 strikeouts, pitched for 7 innings, and only allowed 1 hit. He has the Giants number and I expect him to stay hot in this game. Take Spencer Strider to record more than 8.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>
