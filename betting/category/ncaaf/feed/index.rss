<p>One of the best things about the FanDuel Promo Code is that you will receive this offer regardless of if your first bet wins or loses. With a full slate of College Football, NFL, and MLB games going this weekend, use the FanDuel Promo Code this weekend.</p>
<p><b>Here is a College Football Free Pick, you may want to use your FanDuel Promo Code Bonus Bets on today</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresno State at Arizona State</strong></li>
<li>Date: Saturday Sept. 16, 2023</li>
<li>Time: 10:30 pm  EST</li>
<li>Free Pick from <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/ncaaf/9-16-2023/fresno-state-vs-arizona-state-prediction-3197/">The Admiral</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="analysis">
<p>Arizona State’s offense hasn’t impressed at all through the first two weeks of the new season. The Sun Devils’ defensive line will put a lot of pressure on Mikey Keene, but their offense will struggle to make a difference down the stretch. Jaden Rashada lacks experience, and the Sun Devils’ ground game is far away from an elite level.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs, on the other side, look like a team that can move the ball more frequently than Arizona State. I’m backing Fresno State to come out on top and beat a 3-point line, but it won’t be an easy task by any means.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs are 5-1 ATS in their last six games overall and 7-2 ATS in their previous nine encounters with the Pac-12 Conference. They are undefeated in ten straight outings at any location. The Sun Devils are 1-6 ATS in their last seven games overall, 1-4 ATS in their last five home contests, and 0-5 ATS in their previous five encounters with the Mountain West Conference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta Hawks, Georgia Bulldogs, and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are hopeful that the Georgia Sports Betting will be legalized in the near future. Although this once seemed like a long shot, sports bettors are now extremely optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the United States, sports betting was illegal in most states until 2018, when the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). This decision paved the way for individual states to legalize sports betting, and many states have since done so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different ways to bet on sports. Some of the most common types of bets include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moneyline bets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These bets are simply a wager on which team will win the game.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Point spread bets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These bets involve picking the winner of the game, but also by how many points. For example, if the point spread for a game is -3, the favorite must win by 3 points or more for the bet to be a winner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Over/Under bets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These bets involve predicting the total number of points or goals scored in a game. For example, if the over/under for a game is 50 points, the bettor must predict whether the total score will be more than or less than 50 points.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports betting can be a fun and exciting way to add to the excitement of watching sporting events. However, it is important to remember that it is a form of gambling and there is always the risk of losing money.</span></p>

<h3 id='the-status-of-legalized-georgia-sports-betting'  id="boomdevs_4" ><b>The Status of Legalized Georgia Sports Betting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports betting is not yet legal in Georgia. However, there is a bill that has been introduced in the state legislature that would legalize it. The bill, HB 142, has passed the House of Representatives and is currently being considered by the Senate. If the bill is passed and signed into law, sports betting could be legalized in Georgia as early as 2024.</span></p>
<h3 id='the-future-of-georgia-sports-betting'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>The Future of Georgia Sports Betting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of sports betting in Georgia is uncertain. However, with the passage of House Bill 142, it seems likely that sports betting will eventually be legalized.</span></p>
<h2 id='how-does-the-betmgm-bonus-code-work'  id="boomdevs_6" id="how-does-the-betmgm-bonus-code-work" ><strong>How does the BetMGM Bonus Code work?</strong></h2>
<p>A lot of bettors hear about bonuses, but how does it work? How can this bonus help you as a player?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you win your first wager at BetMGM, you get to keep the bet and the profit. It will then become withdrawable cash.</li>
<li>If you lose your first bet, your account will be credited with bonus bets which are equal to the amount you wagered. However, if you want to see the full $1,500 back in bonus bets, you are required to deposit and bet the max of $1,500. If you deposit and wager just $100 and it fails to win, you’ve accumulated $100 in bonus bets. If you deposit and bet $500 and it loses, you would receive $500 back in bonus bets. The same applies to any amount.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='what-does-the-betmgm-bonus-code-mean'  id="boomdevs_7" id="what-does-the-betmgm-bonus-code-mean" ><strong>What does the BetMGM Bonus Code mean?</strong></h2>
<p>The BetMGM Bonus Code is entitled “WINNERS”, which gets you a $1000 first bet offer as a new customer.</p>
<h2 id='you-can-make-more-by-referring-a-friend-with-your-betmgm-code'  id="boomdevs_8" id="you-can-make-more-by-referring-a-friend-with-your-betmgm-code" ><strong>You can make more by Referring a Friend with your BetMGM Code</strong></h2>
<p>BetMGM’s “refer a friend” bonus is another option where you can increase your bankroll without placing a bet. You can refer up to 20 friends and each time when one of your friends signs up with BetMGM, both of you will receive $50 in bonus bets.</p>
<p>For you to claim your bonus, your friend will need to make their first deposit and place the $50 of their bonus.</p>

<p><b>Will Texas Upset Alabama tonight?</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Longhorns at Alabama Crimson Tide</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Date: Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time: 7:00 PM EST </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds: Alabama -7 O/U 54.5</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert College Football Writer Michael Briggs states:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Longhorns may be relevant again but don&#8217;t expect another close game between these teams in Tuscaloosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alabama defense is going to give Texas a rude awakening. Sure, the Longhorns have star talent, but wait &#8217;til you see what the locked-in Bama defense does to them on Saturday. The Crimson Tide were almost robotic in their shutdown performance against Middle Tennessee and will look to expose Ewers and Texas as frauds for even entering the conversation of college football&#8217;s elite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On offense, Alabama will score enough to win and cover. It&#8217;s a disciplined team (zero turnovers and two penalties in week one) — but that&#8217;s hardly surprising given the accountability on the Bama roster. This is a professional program brimming with players with realistic NFL aspirations. They understand if they&#8217;re not accountable on every play, there&#8217;s a guy behind them ready and able to take their job. The Tide committed 15 penalties against Texas last season, something Saban has likely reminded his players about more than once this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milroe&#8217;s dual-threat ability will be a factor on Saturday, forcing the Longhorns to take some of their attention off the Crimson Tide&#8217;s other playmakers. That will prove deadly on several occasions, giving Bama the cushion it needs to comfortably cover the seven-point spread.</span></p>
<p><strong>Prediction: Alabama -7</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FanDuel Promo Code offer is truly one of the best available among all sportsbooks. What makes FanDuel’s offer great is it is easy to understand, and it is a benefit to everyone who receives it. With FanDuel, new users will receive <a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_28100b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=28100&amp;adid=2436&amp;c=">$200 in Bonus Bets + $100 off on NFL Sunday Ticket</a>, regardless of if their first qualifying bet wins or loses on the first bet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I personally love how <a href="https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_28100b_2436c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=28100&amp;adid=2436&amp;c=">FanDuel</a> overall has been to easy to work with. Their customer service is excellent, and they also offer a great variety of payout options. Depositing and making withdrawals are also easy.</span></p>
<p>Want a second opinion to tonight&#8217;s Texas vs Alabama game?</p>
<p><b>StatSalt.com Expert College Football Writer Craig Forde states:</b></p>
<div class="analysis">
<p>Nothing like a massive game this early in the season, the results of which could set the tone for the rest of the pack seeking CFP bids. The Longhorns have stated this week that they will be looking to test Milroe’s arm, after holding Rice to just 149 passing yards and two interceptions. The Tide QB threw the ball just 18 times last week and though the Tide’s starting QB was able to complete 71% of those passes, it was against a defensive backfield that pales in comparison to what the Longhorns are going to throw at him. Texas’ defense is also athletic enough to chase him down should Milroe free himself of the pocket. Last season’s meeting was a 20-19 classic that went the way of Alabama. I don’t know if Texas pulls it off in Tuscaloosa, but I do think they will keep things close once again and put themselves in a position for a big W.</p>
<p>Take Texas getting the points.</p>
</div>
<div class="pick"><strong>Prediction: Texas +7</strong></div>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Irish had a great defense last year, but an inconsistent offense kept them from competing for a national Title. Now they have a powerful ground game and one of the best QBs in the nation in Sam Hartman, so you can bet that the Irish will not take their foot off the gas here. They know that they have a shot at the playoffs and can’t afford to look past anyone. Notre Dame is off an easy win against Tennessee State, and they have just Central Michigan on deck, so there is no reason for them not to be focused in this one. Notre Dame has strong edges on both sides of the ball, and they have a massive edge at QB. The Defense will shut Armstrong down while the offense puts up enough to get a solid cover in this one.</span></p>
<p><strong>Prediction: Notre Dame -7.5 </strong></p>

</ul>
<p><b>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert College Football Writer <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/21">Michael Briggs</a> states:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Longhorns may be relevant again but don&#8217;t expect another close game between these teams in Tuscaloosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alabama defense is going to give Texas a rude awakening. Sure, the Longhorns have star talent, but wait &#8217;til you see what the locked-in Bama defense does to them on Saturday. The Crimson Tide were almost robotic in their shutdown performance against Middle Tennessee and will look to expose Ewers and Texas as frauds for even entering the conversation of college football&#8217;s elite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On offense, Alabama will score enough to win and cover. It&#8217;s a disciplined team (zero turnovers and two penalties in week one) — but that&#8217;s hardly surprising given the accountability on the Bama roster. This is a professional program brimming with players with realistic NFL aspirations. They understand if they&#8217;re not accountable on every play, there&#8217;s a guy behind them ready and able to take their job. The Tide committed 15 penalties against Texas last season, something Saban has likely reminded his players about more than once this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milroe&#8217;s dual-threat ability will be a factor on Saturday, forcing the Longhorns to take some of their attention off the Crimson Tide&#8217;s other playmakers. That will prove deadly on several occasions, giving Bama the cushion it needs to comfortably cover the seven-point spread.</span></p>
<p><strong>Prediction: Alabama -7</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nebraska defense looked great against Minnesota, but the Golden Gophers’ passing game pales in comparison to Colorado’s aerial attack. At home in Coach Prime’s first game, the Buffaloes won’t miss a beat offensively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I expect Colorado to play better defensively in week two, too. Sims was turnover-prone and too quick to desert the pocket against Minnesota — that won’t work as well against the athletes on the Colorado defense. They will make the Nebraska QB look too one-dimensional on Saturday, forcing him into picks when he’s pressing for conversions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Buffs take a commanding lead, they won’t relent. I’m very confident they will cover the spread, even with a sample size of one game.</span></p>
<p><strong>Prediction: Colorado -3</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>WinnersandWhiners.com Expert College Football Writer Chris King states:</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s safe to say that neither team was overly impressive on the offensive side of the ball in their respective openers. With that said, at least Iowa has their starting quarterback and a few playmakers on that side of the ball. McNamara transferred from Michigan to take over the starting job with the Hawkeyes and he was solid, though unspectacular, in his team debut. Iowa State failed to impress as they failed to score over the final 28 minutes against Northern Iowa. Without Dekkers or last year’s leading rusher, Jirehl Brock, who left the team as part of the investigation, there’s not a ton to get excited about with the Cyclones. Take Iowa in what should be a rock fight as they reclaim the Cy-Hawk Trophy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the college football season quickly approaching with the rise of online betting across the country, a concerning issue in the state of Iowa has fans thinking what their favorite teams or players might be up to. Between Iowa and Iowa State, 15 total athletes, in addition to two student managers, have been charged with misdemeanors in relation to illegal sports gambling and records tampering, according to KCCI. Once seen as a forbidden space in college athletics, it has raised questions as to where else this happening, as well as how often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Iowa State, it was shocking to see their starting quarterback involved, Hunter Dekkers, who placed 366 wagers since joining the Cyclones, including on a game involving his own team. One of the most stunning bets was from Iowa football player, Aaron Blom, who allegedly placed a bet on the under in a game involving his own team, again, according to KCCI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Hawkeyes and Cyclones, questions remain as to the consequences of these actions, with Iowa State Athletic Director Jamie Pollard saying in the summer, &#8220;Iowa State cannot comment on any student-athletes’ circumstance or eligibility status. We will, however, continue to support our student-athletes as our compliance staff works with the NCAA to sort out questions surrounding their future eligibility for intercollegiate athletics competition.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other schools will certainly be looking to do more diligence on the actions of their student-athletes as well, to avoid these issues in the future, especially as gambling continues to grow. It wouldn’t come as a surprise to see schools start to monitor the phones of their student-athletes or block certain sites within athletic facilities, while increased training and education is top of mind. While only a handful have been found to have done this, there’s little doubt that across the country, this is likely becoming a widespread problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of student-athletes having a stake in things or having a leg up when it comes to information or a gameplan, would skew the lines. At what point does a player take a knee or run up the score, as fans wonder if there was an ulterior motive? It will be a challenge for athletic directors to grab hold of this situation, though with all the money involved in college athletics and gambling, this is an issue that needs to find its way to the forefront. Add in the potential embarrassment of those players involved and it’ll be interesting to see how this story progresses, not only in Iowa, but across the country.</span></p>
<p><b>College Football Expert Chris King has a full breakdown with his side and total predictions for the huge matchup between Iowa at Iowa State for this Saturday.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa vs Iowa State</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday, September 9, 2023</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds at <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesars Sportsbook</a> Iowa -3.5 OU 36.5</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris states: It&#8217;s safe to say that neither team was overly impressive on the offensive side of the ball in their respective openers. With that said, at least Iowa has their starting quarterback and a few playmakers on that side of the ball. McNamara transferred from Michigan to take over the starting job with the Hawkeyes and he was solid, though unspectacular, in his team debut. Iowa State failed to impress as they failed to score over the final 28 minutes against Northern Iowa. Without Dekkers or last year’s leading rusher, Jirehl Brock, who left the team as part of the investigation, there’s not a ton to get excited about with the Cyclones. Take Iowa in what should be a rock fight as they reclaim the Cy-Hawk Trophy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coach &#8220;Prime&#8221; was the backdrop of the game, but his son Shedeur, WR/CB Travis Hunter and RB Dylan Edwards stole the show.

<h2 id='how-does-the-betmgm-kentucky-bonus-code-offer-work'  id="boomdevs_3" id="how-does-the-betmgm-bonus-offer-work" ><strong>How does the BetMGM Kentucky Bonus Code offer work?</strong></h2>
<p>A lot of bettors hear about bonuses, but how does it work? How can this bonus help you as a player?</p>
<p>*For example, if you win your first wager at BetMGM, you get to keep the bet and the profit. It will then become withdrawable cash.</p>
<p>*What happens if I lose my first bet? Your account will be credited with bonus bets which are equal to the amount you wagered. However, if you want to see the full $100 back in bonus bets, you are required to deposit and bet the max of $100. If you deposit and wager just $100 and it fails to win, you’ve accumulated $100 in bonus bets.</p>
<p>So even if you lose, you win! You’ll get a refund in bonus bets equal to whatever you lost, up to $100. Remember that you must use the bonus code WINNERS to claim this offer.</p>
<p>If you are looking to make some money TODAY, check out the picks from <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/">HOTTEST CAPPERS</a> in the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s feature Capper is Mason Folz who is on a RIDICULOUS 21-3 Best Bet Run!<a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/express-checkout/mason-folzs-tuesday-mlb-best-bet-21-3-best-bet-run-p10739?promo_code=B1ZDL2VD"> Snag his Terrific Tuesday MLB Best Bet for Just $29.</a></p>
<h2 id='what-does-the-betmgm-bonus-code-mean'  id="boomdevs_4" id="what-does-the-betmgm-bonus-code-mean" ><strong>What does the BetMGM Bonus Code mean?</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1700782">BetMGM</a> Bonus Code is entitled “WINNERS”, which gets you $100 in Bonus Bets as a new customer.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s “refer a friend” bonus is another option where you can increase your bankroll without placing a bet. You can refer up to 20 friends and each time when one of your friends signs up with BetMGM, both of you will receive $50 in bonus bets.</p>
<p>For you to claim your bonus, your friend will need to make their first deposit and place the $50 of their bonus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/7">Arthur Reyes</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel'  id="boomdevs_1" id="sec-champion-prediction-lsu-tigers-+460-fanduel" ><strong>SEC Champion Prediction: LSU Tigers (+460) @ <a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanDuel</a></strong></h3>
<p>As has been the case for several seasons, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is loaded with talented teams in both the East and West divisions. The defending National Champion Georgia Bulldogs (-110) will win the East Division. I then expect Georgia to face the LSU Tigers (+450) in the conference Championship game, with the Tigers prevailing.</p>
<div id="attachment_1313" class="wp-caption alignright"></div>
<p>LSU Quarterback Jayden Daniels will begin his second season under head coach Brian Kelly, and the offensive line should be much stronger than last season. The Tigers’ receiving corps, led by Malik Nabers (wide receiver) and Mason Taylor (tight end ), is one of the conference’s best. LSU has to play Alabama (+240) on the road, but the Tigers will prevail and win the division.</p>
<h2 id='sign-up-for-fanduel-&#x27a1;-here-&#x2b05;-and-get-$100-in-bonus-bets-+-$100-off-on-the-sunday-nfl-ticket'  id="boomdevs_2" id="sign-up-for-fanduel-&#x27a1;-here-&#x2b05;-and-get-$100-in-bonus-bets-+-$100-off-on-the-sunday-nfl-ticket-for-kentucky-residents" >Sign up for FanDuel <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_24287b_2438c_&amp;affid=12962&amp;siteid=24287&amp;adid=2438&amp;c=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b05.png" alt="⬅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  and Get $100 in Bonus Bets + $100 off on the Sunday NFL Ticket!</h2>
<p>The LSU defense gave up just 22.5 points per game last season and this season is even stronger upfront as Mason Smith is back following a knee injury that left him sidelined for most of the season last year. Linebacker Harold Perkins will create even more problems both against the run and the pass. LSU’s secondary has gone through a huge overall but a pair of transfers will eventually help the unit gel into a strong one after the first few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id='over-under-win-total-best-bets'  id="boomdevs_3" id="over-under-win-total-best-bets" >Over/Under Win Total Best Bets:</h2>
<h3 id='kentucky-wildcats-over-7'  id="boomdevs_4" id="kentucky-wildcats-over-7" ><strong>Kentucky Wildcats over 7 </strong></h3>
<p>Kentucky Wildcats scored an average of only 20.4 points per game last season, but with Liam Coen hired as the new play-caller for the Wildcats, Kentucky should see an improvement immediately. In addition, Kentucky landed a talented transfer quarterback when former North Carolina State Wolfpack signal caller Devin Leary decided to become a Wildcat. Kentucky will have to play Mississippi State as well as Alabama in crossover action but faces Vanderbilt and South Carolina, which should result in victories making eight wins a big possibility.</p>

<h3 id='texas-a-m-aggies-over-8'  id="boomdevs_7" id="texas-a-m-aggies-over-8" ><strong>Texas A&amp;M Aggies over 8 </strong></h3>
<p>Texas A&amp;M was one of the nation’s biggest underachievers in 2022 and still has question marks for this season but with coach Bobby Petrino in charge of play calling for head coach Jimbo Fisher, optimism reigns on the offense under quarterback Connor Weigman and wide receiver Evan Stewart. The Texas A&amp;M defense was young and highly talented last season and will improve with experience. If the offense is able to improve, expect to see the Aggies win at least eight games.</p>

<h3 id='alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5'  id="boomdevs_8" id="alabama-crimson-tide-under-10-5" ><strong>Alabama Crimson Tide Under 10.5 </strong></h3>
<p>Alabama will once again be a highly talented football team in 2023 but the quarterback position remains unsettled. Last season, Alabama won 10 games during the regular season but beat Texas by just one point; beat Texas A&amp;M by only four points; and defeated Ole Miss by just six points. This season Alabama will have new coordinators including offensive coordinator Tommy Reese, while Kevin Steele is the defensive coordinator.</p>
<p>The coaching staff is solid but after losing Bryce Young to the NFL, Alabama has a three-man battle for the starting QB with Jalen Milroe, last season’s backup, the front runner. Alabama punched the over ticket last season, while finishing 4th overall in total offense but will not have the talent this season on that side of the ball as they did last year. The defense was 9th overall last season in points allowed but gave up 84 points in their two losses.</p>

<p>The Tennessee Volunteers finished last season No.1 in the nation in scoring with an average of 46.1 points per game. Quarterback Joe Milton takes the reins this season in Knoxville, and the Volunteers will have each of their top three running backs returning, including Jabari Small, Jaylen Wright, and Dylan Sampson, who combined to rush for 5.6 yards per carry with 29 touchdowns on the ground. Tennessee does not leave the state except for a visit to Florida through the first 6 weeks of the regular season. Tennessee will face either Alabama or Georgia in the SEC title game if the Volunteers make it that far, and stranger things have happened.</p>
