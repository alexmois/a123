<p>One of the best things about the Caesars Promo Code is that you will receive this offer regardless of if your first bet wins or loses. There are 16 NFL games to bet on this week, along with a huge slate of College Football and MLB games! Make sure to take advantage of the Caesars Promo Code this weekend.</p>
<p><b>Here is a NFL game you may want to use your Caesars Promo Code: WINNERSFULL Bonus Bets on today</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Miami Dolphins vs New England Patriots</strong></li>
<li>Date: Sunday, Sept. 17, 2023</li>
<li>Time: 7:20 pm  EST</li>
<li>Free Pick from <a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/nfl/9-17-2023/miami-dolphins-vs-new-england-patriots-prediction-2331/">The Tower</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="analysis">
<div class="analysis">
<div class="analysis">
<p>The home team tends to win these games (five of the last six), which is why taking the Patriots is a great play for Sunday night. Miami&#8217;s run defense is going to be porous if last week is any indication, and New England will definitely be trying to avoid another 55+ passing play day for the offense. Finding early success on the ground will avoid another hole, allowing the Patriots to run their offense freely. Even if they do trail, the Dolphins also struggle to stop passes, dating back to last season, and the Patriots pass protection was sturdy last week. Mac Jones will have time to operate and find receivers.</p>
<p>Miami&#8217;s offense may seem lethal, but the Patriots have had answers for them. Last year, the Dolphins scored 20 in the first meeting and 21 in the second against New England. If anyone had a game plan to neutralize Miami&#8217;s speed, it would be Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. As is, the Patriots have a strong defense. That defensive group was top-10 in yards per pass attempts last year and opened this season with another strong showing. That&#8217;ll be the key to stopping Miami since they don&#8217;t run the ball often. At worst, the Patriots will only lose this game by a few points. A win is very likely too. Take the spread because it&#8217;s safer, but don&#8217;t be afraid of the Patriots moneyline.</p>

<p>The Detroit Tigers get set to square off against the New York Yankees less than a week after losing three of four to the Bombers in Detroit. The Tigers were able to avert a sweep with a win in the series finale last Thursday. Detroit currently sits in third place in the AL Central Division despite a sub-.500 record, well ahead of both the White Sox and Royals&#8230;<a href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/games/mlb/9-5-2023/detroit-tigers-vs-new-york-yankees-prediction-3592/">read more.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday! <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here and I am back again with another MLB Player Prop Parlay! The weekend is finally here and I am looking to pay for all of your drinks tonight. But, first we are going to look at three pitchers that have great matchups and they’ve been putting up STELLAR numbers all season long. So, ride with me today! Hop on these three MLB Player Props and get ready to land back in the GREEN!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2 id='bet-$50-and-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-when-you-sign-up-with-caesar-sportsbook-and-use-promo-code-wawmetaget'  id="boomdevs_2" >Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets <span style="font-weight: 400;">when you sign up with <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesar Sportsbook</a> and USE Promo Code: WAWMETAGET </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>21+ Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" ></h3>
<h3 id="boomdevs_4"><b>Tanner Bibee Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for Bibee on the road, as he is 9-3 on the season with a 3.01 ERA. He has consistently got the job done for his team all season long and he pitched great against this same Blue Jays team just three starts back. He pitched for seven innings and only allowed two earned runs, as I see him putting up similar numbers in this game. He will stay out of trouble for the majority of the game, as I expect him to pitch at least six innings. Toronto hasn’t been going crazy at the plate and I don’t see them lighting up Bibee early. Take him to record more than 17.5 Outs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dylan-cease-over-17-5-outs-recorded-145'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Dylan Cease Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-145)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also really like this spot at home for Dylan Cease. The White Sox fell to the A’s yesterday and they are going to be highly motivated to bounce back in this game. Cease is arguably their best pitcher and he should be ready to bounce back in this game. He struggled against the Rockies in his last start, but now he is facing one of the worst offenses in the league. Oakland is averaging the least amount of runs per game and they are only 3-7 in their last 10. They will struggle in this game and Cease will pitch consistently throughout. Take Dylan Cease to record more than 17.5 Outs with the second pick of our parlay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='spencer-strider-over-8-5-strikeouts-135'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Spencer Strider Over 8.5 Strikeouts (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for the Braves and Strider. The Giants have continued to strike out all season and they haven’t overly impressed me as of late. They are 3-7 in their last 10 games played and they are averaging the fourth most strikeouts per game in the MLB. They are averaging 9.42 strikeouts per game, as this is a perfect spot for Strider at home. He actually faced this same exact Giants team in his last start, as well. In that game, he recorded 10 strikeouts, pitched for 7 innings, and only allowed 1 hit. He has the Giants number and I expect him to stay hot in this game. Take Spencer Strider to record more than 8.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>

<p>The Minnesota Twins will open a series with AL Central rival Detroit on Tuesday night. Check out which side our baseball handicapping expert is leaning towards on this matchup and don’t miss out on a great opportunity and offer from BetMGM.</p>
<p><a href="https://promo.va.betmgm.com/en/promo/sports/welcome-offer?wm=7093829&amp;tdpeh=NYP0010_20220509_Evergreen_BetMGMSportsbook">BetMGM</a> has a tremendous offer that will allow new bettors to grasp up to $1,000 in bonus bets in return if their first wager does not win. The best news is that even if you lose, you win! You’ll get a refund in bonus bets which is equal to whatever you lost, which is up to $1,000. Remember that you must use the bonus code WINNERS to claim this offer.</p>
<p>The slate on Tuesday is baseball-centric, but if you are interested in betting on other sports, <a href="https://promo.va.betmgm.com/en/promo/sports/welcome-offer?wm=7093829&amp;tdpeh=NYP0010_20220509_Evergreen_BetMGMSportsbook">BetMGM</a> has options and offers of your choosing. Follow this<a href="https://promo.va.betmgm.com/en/promo/sports/welcome-offer?wm=7093829&amp;tdpeh=NYP0010_20220509_Evergreen_BetMGMSportsbook"> link</a> to start and use the BetMGM bonus code of WINNERS when signing up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do I get the BetMGM bonus offer for Tuesday?</strong></p>
<p>Our top play on Tuesday from our expert handicapper is the <strong>Over 8.5 Minnesota/Detroit</strong>. Twins’ starter Bailey Ober has been dreadful ins his last three games. He’s allowed 12 runs over his last 14 innings and is 1-2 with a 5.70 ERA against Detroit in six career starts. Ober may also be showing fatigue after throwing over a career-high 126 innings this season between the majors and minors.</p>
<p>The Tigers will go with right-hander Alex Faedo on the mound and he’s not exactly a Cy Young contender. Faedo is 2-4 with a 5.80 ERA this season and has allowed nine home runs in 40.3 innings. At night, he is 1-2 with an 8.68 ERA and has a 4.66 ERA on the road. He is 1-1 with a 6.28 ERA over his last three starts.</p>
<p><strong>Pick: Over 8.5 Minnesota/Detroit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How does the BetMGM Bonus offer work?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of bettors hear about bonuses, but how does it work? How can this bonus help you as a player?</p>
<p>*For example, if you win your first wager at BetMGM, you get to keep the bet and the profit. It will then become withdrawable cash.</p>
<p>*What happens if I lose my first bet? Your account will be credited with bonus bets which are equal to the amount you wagered. However, if you want to see the full $1,000 back in bonus bets, you are required to deposit and bet the max of $1,000. If you deposit and wager just $100 and it fails to win, you’ve accumulated $100 in bonus bets. If you deposit and bet $500 and it loses, you would receive $500 back in bonus bets. The same applies to any amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does the BetMGM bonus code mean?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BetMGM Bonus Code is entitled &#8220;WINNERS&#8221;, which gets you a $1000 first bet offer as a new customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s Friday, which means we are back with the best MLB player props for today that go together well in a parlay!  Today, I am going to trust three pitchers that I have been consistently backing all season, one way or another. When betting on props, it&#8217;s good to find certain players that you can trust. I like to call them “Old Reliables”. These three have been producing for their squads all year, regardless of what team they’ve been on. I also love each matchup for each of these players today. Good luck, and let’s start the weekend with some extra money in our pockets! </span></p>

<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" > </h3>
<h3 id='justin-verlander-over-6-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Justin Verlander Over 6.5 Strikeouts (-130)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this number for Verlander today. This will be his second start with the Astros this season, as I believe he will be settled down and ready to attack. The Angels have also struggled since the All-Star break, as I believe this is a perfect matchup for Verlander. Los Angeles is only hitting .220 as a team in their last five games, and they’re only 3-7 in their last 10. They’re going to struggle at the dish on the road, and Verlander is going to look like his old self. I see him pitching deep into this game, and he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in four of his last five starts. His consistency is there, and with this incredible matchup, I see him dominating. Take Justin Verlander to record over 6.5 strikeouts.  </span></p>





<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-16-5-outs-recorded-120'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Andrew Abbott Over 16.5 Outs Recorded (-120)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this bounce-back spot for Abbott against the struggling Pirates. Pittsburgh is only hitting .233 as a team this season, and I expect Abbott to be extremely motivated in this game. He struggled in his last start, but he’s been a road warrior all year. He is currently 4-1 with a 3.16 ERA on the road, and he has covered this line in four of his last 5 starts. He’s shown that he can show up on the road, and I love this matchup for him. Take Andrew Abbott to record more than 16.5 Outs in today’s game. </span></p>



<h3 id='xzavion-curry-under-5-5-hits-allowed-135'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Xzavion Curry Under 5.5 Hits Allowed (-135)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly don’t think Curry is going to pitch deep enough into this game for the Rays to record six hits against him. He is averaging 2.2 innings pitched per game and he’s only given up more than 2 hits once in his last four games played. But, he’s been consistent over his last 10 games played, as well. He is only allowing 1.8 hits per game in his last 10, as I trust him to show up in this one. Take Xzavion Curry to allow less than 5.5 hits. He won’t pitch deep enough into this game for the Rays to have the opportunity. </span></p>



<h3 id='mason-folz-s-total-parlay-odds-parlay-odds-+464'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Mason Folz&#8217;s Total Parlay Odds: Parlay Odds: +464</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, each of these MLB player prop bets is its own separate entity, but they all have one theme in common. All three of these pitchers have shown that they can get the job done for us in the past and, in Curry&#8217;s case, get the job done by falling short of the number. So, I’m trusting them again today. Betting on parlays and player props can be risky, and that’s exactly why I am turning to my “Old Reliables”. When your back is against the wall, and you desperately need something to hit, you go to your most trusted players or team! And that is exactly what we are doing today. Good luck today, and let’s cash some tickets!</span>   </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting/online-sports-betting/august-11-mlb-player-props-to-bet-on-1174/">August 11 MLB Player Props to bet on</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting">Winners &amp; Whiners - Sportsbooks</a>.</p>

<h3 id='jordan-lyles-kcr-over-5-5-hits-allowed-165'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >Jordan Lyles (KCR) OVER 5.5 Hits Allowed (-165)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is my single favorite player prop of the day! Lyles has allowed at least six hits in six straight road starts, and that trend will continue. The Red Sox are second in MLB in total hits at home this season and have a favorable matchup. Lyles has allowed 19 hits in 13.1 career innings when pitching at Fenway Park. Amongst the active Sox players who will be most excited for this game are Rafael Devers, who is hitting .353 (6 for 17) lifetime off him with four extra base hits, and Justin Turner, who has reached base in eight of his 13 career appearances (.643 OBP) against Lyles.</span></p>

<h3 id='jack-flaherty-bal-over-5-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" >Jack Flaherty (BAL) OVER 5.5 Strikeouts (-130)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Flaherty has posted at least six strikeouts in three of his last four starts, and I expect him to log at least another six against Houston today. Active Astros hitters are just 1 for 13 (.077) lifetime against Flaherty, with five of the 13 at-bats resulting in a strikeout. Houston batters have also been striking out at an extremely high rate recently, recording 38 total offensive punch-outs over the last three games.</p>

<h3 id='amed-rosario-lad-over-0-5-hits-220'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" >Amed Rosario (LAD) OVER 0.5 Hits (-220)</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I love Rosario in this spot. Since being traded from Cleveland and joining the Dodgers, four of Rosairo&#8217;s eight hits have gone for extra bases. Rosario has also dominated Merrill Kelly at the plate with a .833 (5 for 6) all-time batting average against him. I expect Rosario to shine in what should be a high-scoring contest and will bet on him getting at least one hit. </p>

<h3 id='james-paxton-over-17-5-outs-recorded-135'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>James Paxton Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxton in this spot leads me to the first of my favorite MLB prop picks today. The Blue Jays have struggled at the dish over their last five games and Paxton has been great at home. He is currently 6-2 on the year with a 3.34 ERA, but at home, he has been even better. His ERA drops to 2.25 and he is still 2-0. I expect him to pitch deep into this game and give his team a real chance of winning. The Red Sox’ bullpen blew a lead for them earlier this week and they won’t want that to happen again. Pick James Paxton to Record Over 17.5 Outs and you won’t regret it. </span></p>





<h3 id='luis-servino-under-5-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Luis Servino Under 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been fading Servino all season and I expect him to struggle again in this game. He will be going up against a motivated Astros batting lineup and he is only 2-5 with a 7.49 ERA this season. He will struggle to finish players off at the plate and he won’t pitch deep enough into this game to push his strikeout total over the number. He hasn’t recorded six or more strikeouts in six straight games and I don’t expect that to change today. Houston is solid at the plate, as they average the fourth least amount of strikeouts per game. Take Luis Servino to record under 5.5 strikeouts. </span></p>



<h3 id='luis-castillo-over-7-5-strikeouts-120'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Luis Castillo Over 7.5 Strikeouts (-120)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am trusting another road warrior in this game with one of the best strikeout props today. The Angels are striking out the 25th least amount of times this season and they are averaging 11 K’s per game in their last 3. I see that trend continuing, as Castillo has been impressive this season. He only has a 2.88 ERA and he has recorded 149 strikeouts this season. He knows how to put people away and he has also recorded at least seven strikeouts in two of his last three games. Today, he will keep it rolling. Take Luis Castillo to record over 7.5 strikeouts (-120)</span></p>



<h3 id='mason-folz-s-total-parlay-odds-parlay-odds-+418'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Mason Folz&#8217;s Total Parlay Odds: Parlay Odds: +418</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I’ve said before, betting on props isn’t easy. But, if you stay up to date and follow recent trends. You’ll have a chance to consistently cash in. Last week was nice, so we are getting a little bit more aggressive today. All three of these pitchers have what it takes to shut down an offense and they’ve been feeling it as of late! But, these are my three FAVORITE MLB props. That’s what I wanted to give you today. Let’s get those results with the best prop bets today. Good luck! </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='atlanta-braves-+300'  id="boomdevs_4" >Atlanta Braves +300</h3>
<p>The Atlanta Braves have been a consistent force all season. The Braves went into the deadline first in home runs and run differential and already seemed to be the team with the fewest flaws. The Braves did make a noteworthy move to strengthen their bullpen at the deadline, acquiring Brad Hand from the Rockies. Hand has 131 career saves and should be an asset in October.</p>
<h3 id='los-angeles-dodgers-+500'  id="boomdevs_5" >Los Angeles Dodgers +500</h3>
<p>The Dodgers&#8217; offense is elite, but their pitching staff has struggled, ranking 22nd in ERA. The Dodgers did acquire Ryan Yarbrough from the Royals but failed to land Eduardo Rodriguez from the Detroit Tigers. Rodriguez, who posted a 6-5 record and 2.95 ERA heading into August, exercised his no-trade clause and decided to stay in Detroit.</p>
<h3 id='houston-astros-+600'  id="boomdevs_6" >Houston Astros +600</h3>
<p>The Astros made a serious move in their quest to repeat as World Champs, shipping away two of their top prospects to bring back 2022 AL Cy Young winner Justin Verlander. The Astros are getting healthy, and Framber Valdez tossed a no-hitter against Cleveland on the deadline day. The Astros hold strong value at the Bet Fred sportsbook.</p>
<h3 id='tampa-bay-rays-+750'  id="boomdevs_7" >Tampa Bay Rays +750</h3>
<p>The Tampa Bay Rays did not stand pat at the deadline, making several moves, most notably acquiring Aaron Civale from the Cleveland Guardians. With a 5-2 record and 2.34 ERA this season, Civale will only strengthen a staff with the third-best team ERA in baseball.</p>
<h3 id='texas-rangers-+850'  id="boomdevs_8" >Texas Rangers +850</h3>
<p>The American League Pennant has gone through Texas each of the last six seasons, but the Rangers want to expand that range further than Houston. After adding Ardolis Champman to the bullpen in late June, the Rangers made a big splash before the deadline by acquiring Max Scherzer from the Mets, along with Jordan Montgomery and Chris Stratton from the Cardinals.</p>
<h3 id='baltimore-orioles-+1200'  id="boomdevs_9" >Baltimore Orioles +1200</h3>
<p>The Orioles might be the Rodney Dangerfield of the 2023 season. Despite having the best record in the American League, three other teams in the AL have better odds to win the World Series than Baltimore does. The Orioles have been the most profitable team for sports bettors to back this season. The birds did improve their pitching staff at the deadline by acquiring Jack Flaherty from St. Louis and delivering Logan Rinehart from Seattle. With 12-to-1 odds, the Orioles are a great option to buy low on now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Remember that you can lock in any of these teams to win the Fall Classic at Betfred today. Along with futures, Betfred also offers great odds on traditional moneylines, totals, and player props. The Double Dinger promotion will expire on August 31, 2023, so take advantage of this promotion before it is too late.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Happy Friday to everyone, and I hope you are all excited for a BIG weekend! </em><br /><br /><em><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here, and today we are talking about parlays. Yes, we will be picking MLB player props, but to HAMMER the books today, they will have to be special.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a player prop parlay, you have to find multiple picks that have STRONG trends. The three players below have all been playing consistently this season, and more importantly, they’ve been hot as of late. So, ride with these studs today, and let’s look to get rich quickly! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we came up one strikeout short, so I know we are right there!</span> When making a player prop parlay, I like to lean on the conservative side. I don’t take many risky picks just because I want my bet to have the best possibility of winning. I also like to focus on the hottest teams and the hottest players, as they are more than likely going to be your best bet. When a professional baseball player goes on a streak, it is hard for anyone to stop them. So, notice that trend today and get ready to get back into the green! <a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/how-to-make-parlaying-player-props-work-for-you-945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Make Player Props Work for You!</a></p>

<h3 id='braxton-garrett-over-5-5-strikeouts-110'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Braxton Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-110)</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1046" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_21065379_168389774_lowres.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="213" /></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We trusted him last week and he came up one K short. He got hit hard early, but now I see him being confident to bounce back. He has also been consistent all year and even better at home. He’s recorded 57 strikeouts at home and 5 in his last two starts. But, in those two starts, he only pitched a combined 7.2 innings. I see him pitching deeper into this game and stacking the K’s in this one. Take Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>



<h3 id='dane-dunning-over-3-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" ><b>Dane Dunning Over 3.5 Strikeouts (-130)</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1048" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be taking Dane Dunning to show up on the road against the Padres. He has recorded four or more strikeouts in four of his last five games, and I also expect him to be motivated in this start. He’s been great all season, as he is (8-3) on the year, and he has a 3.18 ERA. The Padres have a solid lineup, but I also see them having a lot of strikeout potential. They have big hitters, but if they aren’t hot, then they could struggle. That’s exactly what I see happening, as I expect Dunning to dominate in this one. Take the over 3.5 Strikeouts and expect a solid performance.</span>  </p>



<h3 id='zack-wheeler-over-6-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><b>Zack Wheeler Over 6.5 Strikeouts (-160)</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zack Wheeler might’ve had a slow start to the year, but he has really turned it on as of late. He has recorded seven strikeouts in six of his last seven games, and I really like his matchup in this one. The Pirates have not been spectacular since the break, and they are (4-6) in their last 10. Pittsburgh is also only hitting .232 as a team this season, as I expect them to struggle in this one. Wheeler will come out aggressive and record enough strikeouts to push his total over 6.5. </span></p>



<h4 id='total-parlay-odds-+427-on-draft-kings'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >Total Parlay Odds: +427 on Draft Kings</h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of the players that I have listed above have proven that they can get the job throughout their careers and this season. Today, they have solid matchups, and they’ve been waiting to explode on the mound. So, let’s start the weekend with a little extra cash in our pockets. Parlay these three consistent beasts and get ready to meet us at the window. It’s a BIG Friday and we are looking to strike out the books! Parlays were never meant to be easy, but I believe we’ve done enough research to get the job done. Good Luck!</span></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting/online-sports-betting/mlb-player-prop-parlay-for-friday-july-28th-1032/">MLB Player Prop Parlay for Friday, July 28th</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting">Winners &amp; Whiners - Sportsbooks</a>.</p>
