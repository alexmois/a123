										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id='friday-august-25-best-mlb-player-props-for-parlay'  id="boomdevs_1" >Friday August 25 Best MLB Player Props for Parlay</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday! <a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here and I am back again with another MLB Player Prop Parlay! The weekend is finally here and I am looking to pay for all of your drinks tonight. But, first we are going to look at three pitchers that have great matchups and they’ve been putting up STELLAR numbers all season long. So, ride with me today! Hop on these three MLB Player Props and get ready to land back in the GREEN!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2 id='bet-$50-and-get-$250-in-bonus-bets-when-you-sign-up-with-caesar-sportsbook-and-use-promo-code-wawmetaget'  id="boomdevs_2" >Bet $50 and Get $250 in Bonus Bets <span style="font-weight: 400;">when you sign up with <a href="https://wlwilliamhillus.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_11898b_2486c_&amp;affid=425&amp;siteid=11898&amp;adid=2486&amp;c=">Caesar Sportsbook</a> and USE Promo Code: WAWMETAGET </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>21+ Terms and conditions apply.</b></p>
<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" ></h3>
<h3 id="boomdevs_4"><b>Tanner Bibee Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for Bibee on the road, as he is 9-3 on the season with a 3.01 ERA. He has consistently got the job done for his team all season long and he pitched great against this same Blue Jays team just three starts back. He pitched for seven innings and only allowed two earned runs, as I see him putting up similar numbers in this game. He will stay out of trouble for the majority of the game, as I expect him to pitch at least six innings. Toronto hasn’t been going crazy at the plate and I don’t see them lighting up Bibee early. Take him to record more than 17.5 Outs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='dylan-cease-over-17-5-outs-recorded-145'  id="boomdevs_5" ><b>Dylan Cease Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-145)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also really like this spot at home for Dylan Cease. The White Sox fell to the A’s yesterday and they are going to be highly motivated to bounce back in this game. Cease is arguably their best pitcher and he should be ready to bounce back in this game. He struggled against the Rockies in his last start, but now he is facing one of the worst offenses in the league. Oakland is averaging the least amount of runs per game and they are only 3-7 in their last 10. They will struggle in this game and Cease will pitch consistently throughout. Take Dylan Cease to record more than 17.5 Outs with the second pick of our parlay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id='spencer-strider-over-8-5-strikeouts-135'  id="boomdevs_6" ><b>Spencer Strider Over 8.5 Strikeouts (-135)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this spot for the Braves and Strider. The Giants have continued to strike out all season and they haven’t overly impressed me as of late. They are 3-7 in their last 10 games played and they are averaging the fourth most strikeouts per game in the MLB. They are averaging 9.42 strikeouts per game, as this is a perfect spot for Strider at home. He actually faced this same exact Giants team in his last start, as well. In that game, he recorded 10 strikeouts, pitched for 7 innings, and only allowed 1 hit. He has the Giants number and I expect him to stay hot in this game. Take Spencer Strider to record more than 8.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s Friday, which means we are back with the best MLB player props for today that go together well in a parlay!  Today, I am going to trust three pitchers that I have been consistently backing all season, one way or another. When betting on props, it&#8217;s good to find certain players that you can trust. I like to call them “Old Reliables”. These three have been producing for their squads all year, regardless of what team they’ve been on. I also love each matchup for each of these players today. Good luck, and let’s start the weekend with some extra money in our pockets! </span></p>

<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" > </h3>
<h3 id='justin-verlander-over-6-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Justin Verlander Over 6.5 Strikeouts (-130)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this number for Verlander today. This will be his second start with the Astros this season, as I believe he will be settled down and ready to attack. The Angels have also struggled since the All-Star break, as I believe this is a perfect matchup for Verlander. Los Angeles is only hitting .220 as a team in their last five games, and they’re only 3-7 in their last 10. They’re going to struggle at the dish on the road, and Verlander is going to look like his old self. I see him pitching deep into this game, and he has recorded at least 5 strikeouts in four of his last five starts. His consistency is there, and with this incredible matchup, I see him dominating. Take Justin Verlander to record over 6.5 strikeouts.  </span></p>





<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-16-5-outs-recorded-120'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Andrew Abbott Over 16.5 Outs Recorded (-120)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love this bounce-back spot for Abbott against the struggling Pirates. Pittsburgh is only hitting .233 as a team this season, and I expect Abbott to be extremely motivated in this game. He struggled in his last start, but he’s been a road warrior all year. He is currently 4-1 with a 3.16 ERA on the road, and he has covered this line in four of his last 5 starts. He’s shown that he can show up on the road, and I love this matchup for him. Take Andrew Abbott to record more than 16.5 Outs in today’s game. </span></p>



<h3 id='xzavion-curry-under-5-5-hits-allowed-135'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Xzavion Curry Under 5.5 Hits Allowed (-135)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly don’t think Curry is going to pitch deep enough into this game for the Rays to record six hits against him. He is averaging 2.2 innings pitched per game and he’s only given up more than 2 hits once in his last four games played. But, he’s been consistent over his last 10 games played, as well. He is only allowing 1.8 hits per game in his last 10, as I trust him to show up in this one. Take Xzavion Curry to allow less than 5.5 hits. He won’t pitch deep enough into this game for the Rays to have the opportunity. </span></p>



<h3 id='mason-folz-s-total-parlay-odds-parlay-odds-+464'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Mason Folz&#8217;s Total Parlay Odds: Parlay Odds: +464</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, each of these MLB player prop bets is its own separate entity, but they all have one theme in common. All three of these pitchers have shown that they can get the job done for us in the past and, in Curry&#8217;s case, get the job done by falling short of the number. So, I’m trusting them again today. Betting on parlays and player props can be risky, and that’s exactly why I am turning to my “Old Reliables”. When your back is against the wall, and you desperately need something to hit, you go to your most trusted players or team! And that is exactly what we are doing today. Good luck today, and let’s cash some tickets!</span>   </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting/online-sports-betting/august-11-mlb-player-props-to-bet-on-1174/">August 11 MLB Player Props to bet on</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting">Winners &amp; Whiners - Sportsbooks</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is my single favorite player prop of the day! Lyles has allowed at least six hits in six straight road starts, and that trend will continue. The Red Sox are second in MLB in total hits at home this season and have a favorable matchup. Lyles has allowed 19 hits in 13.1 career innings when pitching at Fenway Park. Amongst the active Sox players who will be most excited for this game are Rafael Devers, who is hitting .353 (6 for 17) lifetime off him with four extra base hits, and Justin Turner, who has reached base in eight of his 13 career appearances (.643 OBP) against Lyles.</span></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Flaherty has posted at least six strikeouts in three of his last four starts, and I expect him to log at least another six against Houston today. Active Astros hitters are just 1 for 13 (.077) lifetime against Flaherty, with five of the 13 at-bats resulting in a strikeout. Houston batters have also been striking out at an extremely high rate recently, recording 38 total offensive punch-outs over the last three games.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I love Rosario in this spot. Since being traded from Cleveland and joining the Dodgers, four of Rosairo&#8217;s eight hits have gone for extra bases. Rosario has also dominated Merrill Kelly at the plate with a .833 (5 for 6) all-time batting average against him. I expect Rosario to shine in what should be a high-scoring contest and will bet on him getting at least one hit. </p>

<h3 id='james-paxton-over-17-5-outs-recorded-135'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>James Paxton Over 17.5 Outs Recorded (-135)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxton in this spot leads me to the first of my favorite MLB prop picks today. The Blue Jays have struggled at the dish over their last five games and Paxton has been great at home. He is currently 6-2 on the year with a 3.34 ERA, but at home, he has been even better. His ERA drops to 2.25 and he is still 2-0. I expect him to pitch deep into this game and give his team a real chance of winning. The Red Sox’ bullpen blew a lead for them earlier this week and they won’t want that to happen again. Pick James Paxton to Record Over 17.5 Outs and you won’t regret it. </span></p>





<h3 id='luis-servino-under-5-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Luis Servino Under 5.5 Strikeouts (-160)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been fading Servino all season and I expect him to struggle again in this game. He will be going up against a motivated Astros batting lineup and he is only 2-5 with a 7.49 ERA this season. He will struggle to finish players off at the plate and he won’t pitch deep enough into this game to push his strikeout total over the number. He hasn’t recorded six or more strikeouts in six straight games and I don’t expect that to change today. Houston is solid at the plate, as they average the fourth least amount of strikeouts per game. Take Luis Servino to record under 5.5 strikeouts. </span></p>



<h3 id='luis-castillo-over-7-5-strikeouts-120'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Luis Castillo Over 7.5 Strikeouts (-120)</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am trusting another road warrior in this game with one of the best strikeout props today. The Angels are striking out the 25th least amount of times this season and they are averaging 11 K’s per game in their last 3. I see that trend continuing, as Castillo has been impressive this season. He only has a 2.88 ERA and he has recorded 149 strikeouts this season. He knows how to put people away and he has also recorded at least seven strikeouts in two of his last three games. Today, he will keep it rolling. Take Luis Castillo to record over 7.5 strikeouts (-120)</span></p>



<h3 id='mason-folz-s-total-parlay-odds-parlay-odds-+418'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" ><strong>Mason Folz&#8217;s Total Parlay Odds: Parlay Odds: +418</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I’ve said before, betting on props isn’t easy. But, if you stay up to date and follow recent trends. You’ll have a chance to consistently cash in. Last week was nice, so we are getting a little bit more aggressive today. All three of these pitchers have what it takes to shut down an offense and they’ve been feeling it as of late! But, these are my three FAVORITE MLB props. That’s what I wanted to give you today. Let’s get those results with the best prop bets today. Good luck! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Happy Friday to everyone, and I hope you are all excited for a BIG weekend! </em><br /><br /><em><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a> here, and today we are talking about parlays. Yes, we will be picking MLB player props, but to HAMMER the books today, they will have to be special.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a player prop parlay, you have to find multiple picks that have STRONG trends. The three players below have all been playing consistently this season, and more importantly, they’ve been hot as of late. So, ride with these studs today, and let’s look to get rich quickly! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we came up one strikeout short, so I know we are right there!</span> When making a player prop parlay, I like to lean on the conservative side. I don’t take many risky picks just because I want my bet to have the best possibility of winning. I also like to focus on the hottest teams and the hottest players, as they are more than likely going to be your best bet. When a professional baseball player goes on a streak, it is hard for anyone to stop them. So, notice that trend today and get ready to get back into the green! <a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/how-to-make-parlaying-player-props-work-for-you-945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Make Player Props Work for You!</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We trusted him last week and he came up one K short. He got hit hard early, but now I see him being confident to bounce back. He has also been consistent all year and even better at home. He’s recorded 57 strikeouts at home and 5 in his last two starts. But, in those two starts, he only pitched a combined 7.2 innings. I see him pitching deeper into this game and stacking the K’s in this one. Take Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts. </span></p>



<h3 id='dane-dunning-over-3-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" ><b>Dane Dunning Over 3.5 Strikeouts (-130)</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1048" src="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres.jpg 768w, https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/USATSI_20938970_168389774_lowres-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be taking Dane Dunning to show up on the road against the Padres. He has recorded four or more strikeouts in four of his last five games, and I also expect him to be motivated in this start. He’s been great all season, as he is (8-3) on the year, and he has a 3.18 ERA. The Padres have a solid lineup, but I also see them having a lot of strikeout potential. They have big hitters, but if they aren’t hot, then they could struggle. That’s exactly what I see happening, as I expect Dunning to dominate in this one. Take the over 3.5 Strikeouts and expect a solid performance.</span>  </p>



<h3 id='zack-wheeler-over-6-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><b>Zack Wheeler Over 6.5 Strikeouts (-160)</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zack Wheeler might’ve had a slow start to the year, but he has really turned it on as of late. He has recorded seven strikeouts in six of his last seven games, and I really like his matchup in this one. The Pirates have not been spectacular since the break, and they are (4-6) in their last 10. Pittsburgh is also only hitting .232 as a team this season, as I expect them to struggle in this one. Wheeler will come out aggressive and record enough strikeouts to push his total over 6.5. </span></p>



<h4 id='total-parlay-odds-+427-on-draft-kings'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >Total Parlay Odds: +427 on Draft Kings</h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of the players that I have listed above have proven that they can get the job throughout their careers and this season. Today, they have solid matchups, and they’ve been waiting to explode on the mound. So, let’s start the weekend with a little extra cash in our pockets. Parlay these three consistent beasts and get ready to meet us at the window. It’s a BIG Friday and we are looking to strike out the books! Parlays were never meant to be easy, but I believe we’ve done enough research to get the job done. Good Luck!</span></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting/online-sports-betting/mlb-player-prop-parlay-for-friday-july-28th-1032/">MLB Player Prop Parlay for Friday, July 28th</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting">Winners &amp; Whiners - Sportsbooks</a>.</p>

<p>When making a player prop parlay, I like to lean on the conservative side. I don’t take many risky picks, just because I want my bet to have the best possibility of winning. I also like to focus on the hottest teams and the hottest players, as they are more than likely going to be your best bet. When a professional baseball player goes on a streak, it is hard for anyone to stop them. So, notice that trend today and get ready to get back into the green! <a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/how-to-make-parlaying-player-props-work-for-you-945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Make Player Props Work for You!</a></p>

<h3 id='braxton-garrett-over-5-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >Braxton Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-130)</h3>



<p>I will be taking Garrett to get over 5.5 strikeouts, as he has played very well as of late and the Rockies have continued to slide in the wrong direction. He has also recorded 106 strikeouts this season and the Rockies strike out the ninth most. They will have a few dreadful innings and Garrett will be able to pitch deep into this game. Pick Braxton Garrett Over 5.5 Strikeouts and trust him at home.</p>

<h3 id='ranger-suarez-over-3-5-strikeouts-120'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >Ranger Suarez Over 3.5 Strikeouts (-120)</h3>



<p>Philadelphia has been one of the hottest teams in the MLB as of late and so has Ranger Suarez. The LHP has recorded 62 strikeouts this season and the Guardians have struggled at the plate at different times this season. Suarez has also recorded at least 4 strikeouts in 4 of his last 5 starts. He will stay solid in this one and push this total over the number.</p>



<h3 id='andrew-heaney-under-6-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" >Andrew Heaney Under 6.5 Strikeouts (-160)</h3>



<p>This number is simply too high, as Heaney has been cold as of late. He has lost three of his last four starts and the Dodgers have shown that they can show up at the dish. He won’t pitch deep enough into this game to push his strikeouts total over the number. L.A. is (8-2) in their last 10 and Heaney hasn’t recorded more than four strikeouts in his last two games. He’s cold right now and his total will remain under the number.</p>

<p>When betting on MLB player props, finding the hottest and coldest players is key. Finding these trends allows you to have a leg up on your competition. Because when someone is HOT, they’re more than likely going to stay on FIRE! These pitchers have all had consistent trends as of late and I don’t expect them to slow down today!  </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting/online-sports-betting/mlb-player-prop-parlay-for-friday-july-21st-1027/">MLB Player Prop Parlay for Friday, July 21st</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://winnersandwhiners.com/betting">Winners &amp; Whiners - Sportsbooks</a>.</p>

<h3 id='randy-arozarena-to-record-one-hit-275'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >Randy Arozarena to Record One Hit (-275)</h3>



<p>I really like the Tampa Bay Rays All-Star, Randy Arozarena to get a hit in Kansas City tonight. He got his swing going in the home run derby this past week and he has a very favorable matchup. The Royals will be starting Alec Marsh and I simply don’t trust him. He is (0-2) on the year and he already has a 7.00 ERA. He will make multiple mistakes early and I expect Arozarena to cash in.</p>



<h3 id=''  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" > </h3>
<h3 id='luis-roberts-jr-to-record-one-hit-250'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" >Luis Roberts Jr. to Record One Hit (-250)</h3>



<p>Can you spot the trend? I’m riding with another All-Star with this pick, as I believe the the Chicago White Sox slugger is primed for a massive second half of the year. He was very impressive through the first 90 games, but he’s only going to get better from here. He is currently hitting .271 and he has a solid matchup in this one. Atlanta will start Charlie Morton on the mound, as he hasn’t impressed me much this season, with just a (4-3) record and 4.12 ERA at home. He will make multiple mistakes and Roberts Jr. will find a way to record one hit in this game.</p>



<h3 id='-1'  id="boomdevs_5" class="wp-block-heading" > </h3>
<h3 id='willy-adames-to-record-one-hit-265'  id="boomdevs_6" class="wp-block-heading" >Willy Adames to Record One Hit (-265)</h3>



<p>I am stepping away from our All-Stars trend with this pick, as I am targeting the Red’s starting pitcher. Cincinnati will be starting Graham Ashcraft on the mound and he struggled through the first half of the year. He is only (4-6) and he has a 6.28 ERA. But, that ERA actually jumps up to 7.95 when he is at home. Adames also played great against the Reds before the break, finishing with five hits in their three game series. I expect the Milwaukee Brewers shortstop to stay hot in this one.</p>



<h4 id='-2'  id="boomdevs_7" class="wp-block-heading" > </h4>
<h4 id='parlay-odds-+162-on-draft-kings'  id="boomdevs_8" class="wp-block-heading" >Parlay odds +162 on Draft Kings</h4>



<p>There are so many different ways that you can attack these Player Prop bets, which is exactly why I love them! We have no limits and we don’t have to focus on an entire team. Just key in on your favorite matchups and get ready to land back in the GREEN! These Player Props also allow you to focus on specific aspects of the game. For example, today we trust these players at the plate. But, just a few weeks back, we only talked about pitchers! Each day changes, but we always have the ability to cash in! So, get ready! Let’s start the weekend STRONG with our parlay today!</p>
<p><em>Betting on player props in any sport is a tough task. It takes a lot of research and you always have to know who is hot! But, Mason has taken care of that for you today. He has kept his head in the books and he KNOWS that these three players have 5 STAR matchups today! So, ride with Mr. Folz and his MLB Player Prop Parlay today and develop your passion for betting on props!</em></p>

<p>Hop on this MLB 3-Leg Player Prop Parlay, and you won&#8217;t regret it!</p>

<h3 id='jack-suwinski-over-0-5-hits-140'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" >Jack Suwinski Over 0.5 Hits (-140)</h3>



<p>The Pittsburgh Pirates have a tough matchup today, but I like the team&#8217;s surging home run and RBI leader to get at least one hit tonight. Pirates centerfielder Jack Suwinksi has faced Diamondbacks starter Zac Gallen six times in his career, with three doubles. No matter who the opposing pitcher has been lately, Suwinski has also been on fire. He is batting .417 with three home runs and 10 RBI over his last eight games, collecting at least one hit in seven of those contests.</p>



<h3 id='trea-turner-over-0-5-hits-250'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" >Trea Turner Over 0.5 HitS (-250)</h3>



<p>This one is a bit juicy, so I recommend including it in a parlay. Trea Turner has hit safely in 10 of his last 12 games and has collected at least two hits in four of his previous seven contests. Turner has also batted .400 against the Marlins starter Sandy Alcantara in 30 at-bats. To make matters even better for Turner, this current version of Alcantara is struggling allowing 31 hits and 15 earned runs in his last 24.1 innings of work.<br>Back Turner with confidence to get at least one hit tonight.</p>



<h3 id='andrew-abbott-over-7-5-strikeouts-+115'  id="boomdevs_3" class="wp-block-heading" >Andrew Abbott Over 7.5 Strikeouts (+115)</h3>



<p>The rookie Southpaw is on a roll with 30 strikeouts over his last 19.2 innings of work, recording at least eight strikeouts in each of his previous three outings. This past Sunday, Abbott struck out 12 San Diego Padres batters with the Reds improving to 6-0 in the games he has started. I am backing Abbott to mow down at least eight Brewers tonight.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://experts.winnersandwhiners.com/cappers/5">Mason Folz</a>, for example, loves to hammer MLB Player Props when he can’t decide on a total or a side. He dives deep into the stats and finds the best possible matchups for the day! Here is Mason&#8217;s Three-Team Parlay Prop Parlay!</em></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week is all about matchups. I want to find teams that have continued to strike out consistently this season. Now, I have found three separate areas that I would like to attack, as I EXPECT to cash in BIG today! It doesn’t matter if you think a team is going to win or lose,  you just have to find one perfect spot. Luckily, I have done that for everyone today! It’s never going to be easy, but once you find success with these props, you won’t look back! Hop on this MLB 3-Leg Player Prop Parlay, and you won’t regret it!</span></p>



<p><a href="https://wp.winnersandwhiners.com/online-sports-betting/how-to-make-parlaying-player-props-work-for-you-945/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Make Player Props Work for You!</span></a></p>



<h3 id='dean-kremer-over-5-5-strikeouts-150'  id="boomdevs_1" class="wp-block-heading" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Kremer Over 5.5 Strikeouts (-150)</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be riding with the Orioles starting pitcher today, as I believe he has a great matchup. He will be facing the Twins, who are averaging the 30th least amount of K’s per game. 10.29 strikeouts per game to be exact, as I see him starting this game hot and pitching deep enough into this game to push this strikeout total over the number. Kremer has also recorded at least five strikeouts in seven straight games. He will continue to attack in this one and record more than (5.5) strikeouts.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 id='jose-berrios-over-4-5-strikeouts-160'  id="boomdevs_2" class="wp-block-heading" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jose Berrios Over 4.5 Strikeouts (-160)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also really like Jose Berrios matchup in this game, as the Red Sox have struggled against RHP in their last five games. In that stretch, they are only hitting .221 vs. RHP and striking out 8.2 times per game. Berrios has been a beast at home as of late and I expect him to show up in this game. He is currently (8-5), but he is (4-1) at home and his ERA drops to 2.48. He has also recorded at least five strikeouts in six of his last eight starts. He’s been playing great and I see him staying hot in this game. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick Jose Berrios to record Over (4.5) strikeouts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3 id='carlos-carrasco-over-4-5-strikeouts-130'  id="boomdevs_4" class="wp-block-heading" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos Carrasco Over 4.5 Strikeouts (-130)</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be taking the over (4.5) strikeouts in this one, as I believe Carlos has a solid matchup in this one. San Francisco is striking out the 28th least amount of times per game and Carrasco has recorded at least five of his last six starts. He hasn’t pitched particularly deep into games, but I think he has a chance to show up at home in this game. The Giants have also been better against LHP, as they are only hitting .241 as a team in their last 10 games against a RHP. They will struggle at different points in this one and Carrasco will record just enough Ks to push this total over the number (4.5).&nbsp;</span></p>
